    "description": "This project will design and construct a state-of-the-art forensic laboratory at 415 4th Street SW. It will be a full-service crime laboratory, medical examiner/morgue facility, and public health laboratory that meets all applicable national standards. The Consolidated Forensics Lab will improve the quality and efficiency of these services by consolidating the operations of the following agencies and divisions into one facility: District of Columbia Public Health Laboratory (DOH); Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME); and Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) Forensic Laboratory. This consolidation will result in better coordination of services for public safety and a reduction on the current backlog of crime investigations. The scope of work for this project includes, but is not limited to the following: development of architectural and engineering scope of work; demolition of existing MPD First District (MPD 1-D); construction; facility commissioning; fit-up relocation; laboratory equipment including new Lab IT Solution (LIM); and occupancy of the facility.",
    "justification": "All three agencies involved with the project are currently working inside aging facilities that do not meet today’s scientific standards. In addition, the District wants to expand its capabilities in supporting public safety/public health sectors by conducting new scientific investigations that are not being performed today. The project is a priority for the Mayor and Council.",

EIS provides the ability to create ad-hoc reports when needed, and CFO$ource provides standard reports.

The project has been implemented over the past five (5) years in an incremental manner, with new functionality added to the various modules of the system every year. The CFO$ource system has grown into a District-wide system that is the primary mechanism to develop and manage the District’s budget. As the needs of District stakeholders change, new requirements have been identified including capital position budgeting, revenue budgeting, and automating the budget revision process. In addition, the underlying servers and software hosting the system are now outdated and no longer supported by the manufacturers, and must be replaced.",

The tax system modernization will be achieved in stages to replace individual components starting with the case management module, real property system, and eventually the core tax management system.",
    "justification": "The first phase is to replace the real property tax module, to address and reduce the risk of fraud and mismanagement by leveraging superior internal controls and industry best practices implemented in the replacement system. In addition, the new case management system will provide intelligent case analytics, review, and analysis abilities that will result in increased tax compliance and collections for the city, resulting in increased revenues for the city.",
    "progress_assessment": "The project is currently in the planning phase and high-level designs of all the different projects within the modernization initiative are being developed. The District’s project manager for this effort has been hired. Currently, requirements are being collected for the case management and real property tax system modules.",

In mid-FY 2008, DCRA launched Phase I of the Comprehensive Property Management System (CPMS), with anticipation of launching Phase II in early FY 2010. The CPMS enables the tracking of all information associated with a property address. It links permits to inspections, and violations to abatement activity or civil fines. It will allow agency personnel to work smarter with quick query functions to review “all” address-related information to provide a more comprehensive customer response. CPMS will also interface with other District IT systems, facilitating data sharing with Office of Tax and Revenue, the Department of Environment, Department of Health, Department of Transportation, Office of Zoning, Office of Planning and others.",

The subproject consists of acquisition, assemblage, site preparations, and demolition and stabilization of property to promote housing, affordable housing, and economic development opportunities. Projects for acquisition are identified in areas where the District can make an investment to enhance and complement development projects being undertaken by the private or non-profit sectors, as well as neighborhoods with substantial concentrations of vacant and abandoned property. Acquisition methods include friendly sales, tax foreclosures, and eminent domain. Included are technical studies, appraisals, environmental assessments, title reviews, and other acquisition expenses, in addition to the actual cost of acquisition of real property.

The vision of the new resource center is to offer the public a one-stop shop for information and services on all DHCD programs, although DHCD’s divisions do not share a common IT system for linking customers to similar programs and services across the Department. DHCD seeks a case management system for the new resource center that has the following features: case initiation, case processing, schedule management, calendar management, record keeping, document management, fee collections and accounting, reporting, security, and third party interfaces.",

The project builds on an FY08-09 Fannie Mae grant to DHCD to engage KPMG LLP in developing business requirements for a case management tracking system that does more than simply allow for electronic document management; DHCD needs customer intake, multiple searchable fields, and interfaces with the public and other agencies.",

    "description": "This project is a major renovation of Engine Company 16 which is at 1018 13th Street, NW. This station houses and supports the operations of Engine 16, Tower 3, Ambulance 16, Battalion Chief 6, EMS Supervisor 6 and the Offices of the Emergency Medical Division that are on the 3rd floor. Engine 16 is strategically located in the downtown area and is one of the busiest stations in the District providing essential Fire and EMS coverage to the White House and the Wilson Building. The proposed work includes major improvements and upgrades that will bring the facility into compliance with current basic standards such as ADA access, Life Safety, female firefighter locker room accommodations, firefighting protective gear storage and energy efficient HVAC systems. Although it is structurally sound the infrastructure of the facility is worn out and has far exceeded its projected life span. The main roof is in good condition but the copula and penthouse roofs need to be replaced. The interior of this historic building will be redesigned and all of the building’s electrical and lighting systems and plumbing will be replaced to the Silver level of the LEED standard. A new emergency back up electrical generator that will be capable of powering the entire building will be installed as well as refurbishing the elevator. Most important will be the new Life Safety features by the installation of a fire sprinkler and fire alarm system. A temporary fire station will provide uninterrupted protection to the community during this project.",

The electrical system has insufficent capacity and does not meet safety codes. Water damage is a constant problem because the storm drain system is in disrepair and needs to be replaced to work properly.",

In 1984, Engine 12 was re-located to 5th Street and Rhode Island Avenue NE, with the long term plan to move Engine 26 further east. This plan has become more crucial because of the development at Ft. Lincoln in an area that is too far from any fire station. Fire & EMS is working with the Office of Planning in identifying a site for the new Engine 26.",

The fire incident reporting system is outdated and needs a major overhaul in order to meet National Fire Incident Reporting System Requirements, and to provide incident event data streams to the City Wide Data Warehouse and other tactical operational support platforms and or dashboards for emergency response and public health.  Several major business processes need modernization and electronic work flow processing.  This project proposes to modernize all major business functions, identify business processes in need of re-engineering, identify software requirements and cost benefit analysis, and procure fire department specific solutions that best meet the specific program missions, goals and objectives of the agency. Major Objectives include: 1) Develop Project Plan for modernizing F&EMS business processes. 2) Identify requirements for all core business functions in dire need of electronic record keeping and business processes re-engineering. 3) Upgrade or replace existing systems and integrate with data streams from the OUC 911 Center. 4) Deploy business unit modules in phased deployments over 3 years. 5) Upgrade existing applications, database, and web servers to support integrated data management with other agencies.",

Training, personnel, staffing, and resource deploymenttools need to be integrated across systems in order to provide more effective management and reporting capabilities.  Many programs are burdened by paper processes that need converting to electronic forms and database capture.",

The completed project will represent the latest technology in the correctional field. Scope involves design and construction of cell door mechanism and control systems. All the systems to be designed and replaced are located at the Central Detention Facility (CDF, or D.C. jail) at 1901 D St, S.E., Washington DC, 20003.",
    "justification": "Cell door systems form the core of the jail’s security system, and are an integral part of the overall security apparatus. Repair of cell door systems was identified as a critical project in the District’s Facility Assessment Report of 2001. The project aligns with the Mayoral initiative of improving control over inmates and their movement at the CDF, thereby keeping District residents safe and secure. The electronic and mechanical systems of the cell door operating mechanisms at the D.C. jail are over 30 years old. Over 60% of total work orders in FY08 were about malfunctioning cell door and control systems. In addition, upgrade of the cell door systems will help reduce maintenance costs and liability risks.",

The SLED will be populated with information extracted from disparate enterprise educational systems into a single comprehensive relational database. It will standardize student academic information currently stored in various local education agencies (LEAs) and it will track student information statewide over multiple years and across education institutions. Once built, the SLED will enable the sharing of critical information that tracks student learning spanning early care and education, K-12 programs, post-secondary, and adult education. It will ultimately link to other youth and adult serving institutions to provide a comprehensive picture of the District of Columbia’s learners.",

Shared classroom space for classes such as art and music require the same attention as regular classrooms, particularly in high schools where non-core classes and extracurricular programs are a key component of a well-rounded academic program. Other school space such as auditoriums, gymnasiums and locker rooms currently reflect some of the most serious neglect in our schools. These spaces must be renovated to support a full range of extra-curricular offerings that help create a well-rounded educational environment. Modernization of these Support Component features in school buildings is important to the overall educational environment and must be addressed with the same strategic approach, focusing on those most in need in order to support the academic program and to complement modernization work for core Academic Components.",

    "description": "This project supports a Systems Component modernization to upgrade and extend the life of each school facility. For some schools, Systems Component modernization may involve targeted small capital projects needed to update or replace components of a facility that is otherwise stabilized - increasing the school's electrical capacity to support computer labs or repairing or replacing a broken chiller that no longer adequately cools the gymnasium and auditorium, for example. In some cases, a facility may lack any air conditioning, and Systems Component modernization will rectify this issue.",
    "justification": "The continuing modernization of schools supports the vision of the Mayor and Office of the Chancellor as identified in the DC Schools Master Facilities Plan. Modernization will ensure that the DC Public Schools provide a quality learning environment that will deliver classrooms supporting educational needs and provide safe, positive learning environments to District schoolchildren.",

    "description": "Department of Parks and Recreation's program for Summer 2009 Pool Readiness began in October 2008. The first phase included outdoor pool cover installation and Federally mandated indoor drain cover installation. Outdoor pool covers were purchased and installed to eliminate debris and foliage that accumulate in exposed pools during the winter. Pool drain coves minimize the amount of painting, sanding, and labor needed to prepare for summer pool season and help preserve the life of the District’s major capital investments. FY 2008 is the first year that the District has installed covers at all of its outdoor sites. Phase two includes outdoor drain cover installation and is required upon opening of District pools in May.",
    "justification": "Federally mandated pool main drain covers are being installed at all indoor and outdoor pools. The Virginia Graeme Baker Pool and Spa Safety Act requires that all pools and spas be equipped with certified drain covers or grates to prevent entrapment and evisceration. Pools in use must meet the Federal mandate by December 20, 2008. FY 2009 is the first year that the District has installed federal mandated drain covers. Additionalfunding is needed to continue the year-round efforts that need to be made to ensure continuous pool readiness.",

    "description": "The District’s lighting assets are critical to the safety of District’s residents and visitors. These assets are also essential for the well-being of businesses, commuters, and pedestrians. DDOT entered into a five-year performance-based contract with an electrical contractor to maintain the District’s lighting assets. The contractor is responsible for managing all lighting assets within public space, including alleys and streetlights, highways, underpasses, tunnels, bridges, navigation lights, overhead guide signs, and “Welcome to Washington, DC” signs. A number of lighting systems and the electrical control systems for the Frederick Douglas Bridge are also included. In this performance-based asset preservation contract, the desired outcome is specified rather than the means and methods: the contractor is instructed what to achieve, not how to achieve it. The District requires that the contractor meet a set of performance standards for all assets and DDOT personnel conduct citywide monthly and annual inspections to measure the contractor’s performance. DDOT personnel also monitor the contractor’s response for repair requests and schedules daily. The contract includes both incentives and disincentives for failing or exceeding these performance measures. The asset contractor has improved the lighting performance by reducing outages from a high of 20 percent two years ago (FY07) to less one percent this year (FY09).",
    "justification": "This project is necessary for the safety of District residents and drivers. The performance-based contract has proven to be the most cost-effective way to ensure that the District’s streetlights are illuminating the streets.

This project also includes utilities consolidation that will create a stand-alone HVAC, electrical, and domestic hot water systems for the RMB building and the new hospital independent of the aging campus utilities systems. The second phase of this project will upgrade former patient areas to accommodate new staffing functions that cannot be accommodated in the new hospital, including auxiliary dental services, office space, and relocation of the lobby entrance. The renovated RMB building will provide office space and additional capacity to serve patients outside of the main hospital building, which will house roughly 300 patients. Saint Elizabeths currently serves approximately 400 patients.",
    "justification": "This project is needed to provide accommodations for four (4) patient wards and ancillary staff. This space will provide added capacity as the Department of Mental Health works to reduce the patient census at Saint Elizabeths by improving outpatient services and adding capacity in other hospitals. This project will also consolidate utilities on the campus, allowing the new hospital and RMB to operate independent of an aging utilities system serving other parts of the campus. Once complete, this project will allow all but two buildings to be vacated and become available for mixed-use development.",
    "progress_assessment": "This project is progressing as planned. There are challenges facing this project, as the building is currently occupied, and the pace of progress is slower than it would be had the building been vacant.",

    "description": "Information is one of the most under-utilized assets in government. Without the proper data sharing in place, government agencies often bear all costs associated with collecting, storing, and protecting data without realizing any noticeable benefits. The Citywide Data Warehouse’s (CityDW) mission is to democratize government data by providing a centralized access point for enterprise-wide data to agencies, employees and citizens. The focus is on providing real-time operational data from multiple agencies and sources to enable decision support and government transparency. To that extent, CityDW works with District agencies to supply both data and business intelligence tools. CityDW gathers data and builds reporting environments for agencies. CityDW also builds custom applications and dashboards to display the data. One example is the District’s Data Catalog and Data Feeds. For years the District of Columbia has provided public access to city operational data through the Internet. In 2004 the District started providing near real-time data from multiple agencies to citizens, to help agencies operate as more responsive, better performing organizations. The Data Catalog can be used to view or download a variety of data like crimes, service requests and procurements.",
    "justification": "One of the significant achievements of the CityDW is that it leverages citizen participation in government in new ways. For example, for a limited investment of $50,000, the Apps For Democracy contest challenged anyone to utilize information available from CityDW’s data feeds. Local developers produced 47 applications that were conceived, developed, and delivered in 30 days (www.appsfordemocracy.org). By treating citizens as co-creators of government, the District secured software worth an estimated $2.6 million that the government alone would not have been able to create, particularly in this economic climate. The District has put seven of the applications in use since the contest concluded in November 2008.",
    "progress_assessment": "CityDW now publishes over 200 datasets via the Data Catalog (http://data.octo.dc.gov/), and built four applications that are available to the public that make it easy to access and view data including crime and service requests on a map.",

In addition, it will enable the use of self-service for all city employees and extend for the first time the use of the applications to include non-employees such as contractors and volunteers, eliminate paper forms, support 360-degree performance feedback and secure access for DC employees from outside DC’s network. This program implements a single enterprise wide software platform that will replace several DCHR IT legacy systems (HR Gateway, PMP, PES, ASPEN SumTotal, and paper/excel documents/reports). Operating costs are reduced by 1) eliminating DCHR’s IT support and maintenance costs for its stand-alone applications, 2) streamlining HR operations, and 3) reducing amount of printed paper.

    "description": "The OUC is responsible for the operation and maintenance of the Unified Communications Center (UCC) and the Public Safety Communications Center (PSCC) communications and infrastructure, which serve to consolidate all communications functions of the District of Columbia, including 9-1-1 and 3-1-1, Police, Fire, EMS dispatching, call handling and related call taking operations. The radio system is a primary component of the communications infrastructure as it supports 10 million radio and 20 million push-to-talk calls annually. The ongoing project is a comprehensive system upgrade to the APCO Project (P25 7.1) inclusive of component and radio replacements. As the District’s primary dispatch and radio communications provider to first responders (MPD, FEMS) but also secondary responders DDOT, DOH, HSEMA and regional communications, it is imperative that the latest technology enhancements are implemented to further promote and enhance public safety initiatives. The process of upgrading the system will require replacement of several system components. It is necessary to continue the process proactively to ensure there are no gaps in efficiency or effect on public safety. Additionally, upgrading MPD from its current platform of 460MHz to the 700/800 MHz standard currently implemented in FEMS and HSEMA will remove existing limitations and provide seamless interoperable communications to the National Capital Region (NCR).",
    "justification": "The OUC has set a new standard of excellence in the realm of public safety and response time to emergency situations and upgrading the backbone of the communications system (radio) is critical to this mission.",

It will be a full-service crime laboratory, medicalexaminer/morgue facility, and public health laboratory that meets all applicable national standards. The Consolidated Laboratory facility will improve the quality and efficiency of these services by consolidating the operations of the following agencies and divisions into one facility: District of Columbia Public Health Laboratory (DOH); Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME); and Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) Forensic Laboratory. This consolidation will result in better coordination of services for public safety and a reduction on the current backlog of crime investigations. The scope of work for this project includes, but is not limited to the following: development of architectural and engineering scope of work; demolition of existing MPD First District (MPD 1-D); construction; facility commissioning; fit-up relocation; laboratory equipment including new Lab IT Solution (LIM); and occupancy of the facility.",

    "justification": "The project will achieve a full system upgrade of all major components of the District’s General Ledger system. The current District General Ledger system is based on 20 year old technology. Supporting this technology is becoming ever more complicated since the resources and skill-sets needed to support a mainframe based system are not easily available. Moreover, the current General Ledger system lacks functionality found in modern systems necessary to support real-time financial management and allow the OCFO to provide greater integration with other key District systems such as the cash management system, budgeting systems, Human Resources and Payroll systems, and the tax systems.",

Projects for acquisition are identified in areas where the District can make an investment to enhance and complement development projects being undertaken by the private or non-profit sectors, as well as neighborhoods with substantial concentrations of vacant and abandoned property. Acquisition methods include friendly sales, tax foreclosures, and eminent domain. Included are technical studies, appraisals, environmental assessments, title reviews, and other acquisition expenses, in addition to the actual cost of acquisition of real property. Also included are costs of demolition, site improvements and other site preparation costs associated with acquisitions of real property. Finally, once the property is owned by the District, this project pays for costs related to the rehabilitation and the stabilization of the real property, including but not limited to engineering and/or architectural reports and drawings, as well as the development of solicitation for offers. Disposition methods include solicitations for offers, auctions of scattered sites, a combination solicitation and lottery for developers and homebuyers, as well as negotiated sales.",

    "description": "This project is a major renovation of Engine Company 4, which is at 2531 Sherman Ave. N.W. This station houses and supports the operations of Engine 4, Ambulance 4, Air 1 (the Air Mask Support Unit), the Office of Risk Management, and the office of the Special Operations Battalion Fire Chief. Engine 4 is strategically located near Howard University and provides essential Fire and EMS coverage to Wards 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 on a daily basis. The work includes major improvements and upgrades that will bring the facility into compliance with current basic standards such as ADA access, Life Safety, female firefighter locker room accommodations, and energy efficient HVAC systems. The building will be redesigned to the Silver level of the LEED standard and all of the building’s electrical and lighting systems, roof systems, and deteriorated concrete, and plumbing will be replaced. Most important will be the new Life Safety features by the installation of a fire sprinkler and fire alarm system. A temporary fire station will be built to provide uninterrupted fire protection to the Pleasant Plains neighborhood.",
    "justification": "This building has not had any major improvements or upgrades since it was constructed in 1976 so it does not comply with current basic standards such as ADA access, female firefighter locker room accommodations, or an energy efficient HVAC system. Although it is structurally sound the infrastructure of the facility is worn out and has exceeded its projected life span resulting in poor conditions for the First Responders and other Department personnel that work there.",

    "justification": "This capital project is for the relocation of the existing fire station at 1340 Rhode Island Avenue, NE. Due to changes in the demographics of the District of Columbia and the strategic plans of the Fire and EMS Department, it is necessary to relocate this station. Our response mapping has identified a particularly under served area east of the current fire station. Maintaining the current location lessens our ability to provide effective service delivery and meet our response time criteria. This project includes site acquisition and construction of a new fire station to house the current companies located at 1340 Rhode Island Ave. N.E., in order to improve our service delivery to the community.",

The work will include fairly complete interior demolition with a new floor plan to include sufficient lockers and toilets for men and women, negative pressure gear locker storage room, and watch desk area. The project will include new plumbing and fire protection systems throughout as well as upgrades and extension of the existing HVAC, mechanical and electrical systems in the building. Work on the exterior will be minor and will include repairs to the existing brick façade and slate tile roof. The concrete on the apparatus bays will be replaced and floor drains installed and the front ramp will be repaired. All interior doors and frames will be replaced. This project will bring the building to LEED Silver standard when completed.",

    "description": "DC Fire and EMS is in critical need of updating and modernizing its work flow and reporting capabilities for several business functions.  The fire incident reporting system is outdated and needs a major overhaul in order to meet National Fire Incident Reporting System Requirements, and to provide incident event data streams to the City Wide Data Warehouse and other tactical operational support platforms and or dashboards for emergency response and public health.  Several major business processes need modernization and electronic work flow processing.  This project proposes to modernize all major business functions, identify business processes in need of re-engineering, identify software requirements and cost benefit analysis, and procure fire department specific solutions that best meet the specific program missions, goals and objectives of the agency. Major Objectives include: 1) Develop Project Plan for modernizing F&EMS business processes. 2) Identify requirements for all core business functions in dire need of electronic record keeping and business processes re-engineering. 3) Upgrade or replace existing systems and integrate with data streams from the OUC 911 Center. 4) Deploy business unit modules in phased deployments over 3 years. 5) Upgrade existing applications, database, and web servers to support integrated data management with other agencies.",
    "justification": "The existing software and hardware systems are beyond end of life, at high risk for systems failure, and need to be brought up to date to meet current DC government requirements for data security, redundancy, COOP, and HIPAA security requirements. Several interagency programs would like to obtain data streams from F&EMS, but the data is not available electronically.  Training, personnel, staffing, and resource deploymenttools need to be integrated across systems in order to provide more effective management and reporting capabilities.  Many programs are burdened by paper processes that need converting to electronic forms and database capture.",
    "progress_assessment": "Preliminary work has begun in examining business processes and workflow, and identifying priorities for modernization.",

Many facility components(e.g. roofs, boilers, windows, etc.) at Dunbar SHS Modernization are in failure, or near failure modes. Operations and maintenance activities are unable to correct these problems due to cost. As these deficiencies continue, costs increase, not just in facility dollars, but more importantly on the impact of ability of the school to deliver quality curriculum in the classrooms. This revitalization will be accomplished through a revitalization/modernization or new building at Dunbar SHS Modernization and also bring the structure in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act(ADA). Further, this project will also eliminate the many facility emergencies that occur as the result of years of maintenance neglect in the past. Comprehensive modernization/revitalization of all major systems and components including roofs, windows and frames, exterior and interior doors and frames, exterior walls, site work, interior finishes, electrical, mechanical, life-safety equipment and compliance with legislative requirements, including health and safety issues.",

Shared classroom space for classes such as art and music require the same attention as regular classrooms, particularly in high schools where non-core classes and extracurricular programs are a key component of a well-rounded academic program.

These spaces must be renovated to support a full range of extra-curricular offerings that help create a well-rounded educational environment. Modernization of these Support Component features in school buildings is important to the overall educational environment and must be addressed with the same strategic approach, focusing on those most in need in order to support the academic program and to complement modernization work for core Academic Components.",

These amenities do not adequately serve the needs of the public, and DPR hopes to fund a significant expansion of the facility.

As such, there is a unique opportunity to use this park and recreation center to enhance public awareness of environmental issues. This is also an underserved area of the District that would benefit from enhanced green infrastructure. Finally, there is a need within the Anacostia Watershed to mitigate environmental impacts caused by the built environment; by replacing the aging recreation center with a new, LEED-certified building, DPR would aid in achieving the Mayor’s Green Team environmental goals for the District.",

The system would enable District agencies to assist clients in a more holistic manner.

The system will greatly modernize the eligibility determination system, leading to a faster, more accurate eligibility determination mechanism.",

    "description": "The District’s lighting assets are critical to the safety of District’s residents and visitors. These assets are also essential for the well-being of businesses, commuters, and pedestrians. DDOT entered into a five-year performance-based contract with an electrical contractor to maintain the District’s lighting assets. The contractor is responsible for managing all lighting assets within public space, including alleys and streetlights, highways, underpasses, tunnels, bridges, navigation lights, overhead guide signs, and “Welcome to Washington, DC” signs. A number of lighting systems and the electrical control systems for the Frederick Douglas Bridge are also included. In this performance-based asset preservation contract, the desired outcome is specified rather than the means and methods: the contractor is instructed what to achieve, not how to achieve it. The District requires that the contractor meet a set of performance standards for all assets and DDOT personnel conduct citywide monthly and annual inspections to measure the contractor’s performance. DDOT personnel also monitor the contractor’s response for repair requests and schedules daily. The contract includes both incentives and disincentives for failing or exceeding these performance measures. The asset contractor has improved the lighting performance by reducing outages from a high of 20 percent two years ago (FY07) to less one percent this year (FY09).",
    "justification": "This project is necessary for the safety of District residents and drivers. The performance-based contract has proven to be the most cost-effective way to ensure that the District’s streetlights are illuminating the streets. In FY 2008, 1,400 streetlights were repaired and 900 alley lights were upgraded through this project. Funding is necessary to continue this type of maintenance, repairs, and upgrades.",
    "progress_assessment": "The contract is progressing as planned. This contract has improved the District’s lighting system by reducing outages and other unsafe conditions thus resulting in improved customer satisfaction as compared to previous years.",

    "description": "The District of Columbia has over 682 local roadway miles that require preservation, maintenance, and repair. The District Department of Transportation (DDOT) has developed an annual work (construction) schedule that continuously assesses the needs of every local street in the District. Depending on the condition of the roadway, DDOT will provide service from basic mill and overlay (for resurfacing needs) to complete reconstruction and upgrade. Regardless of the construction type, DDOT’s focus is to also repair or replace the adjacent sidewalks, curbs, and gutters in conjunction to the street repair, if applicable. In addition, DDOT has established a ward based contract which allows timely and successful implementation and execution of work plans. Annual work (construction) plans are based on the available funding and fulfill the Mayor's initiatives and objectives and benefits the residents as well. There is a separate road reconstruction project for each ward.",
    "justification": "DDOT’s goal is to preserve our current roadway system and provide maintenance as needed. This service helps to avoid the more costly reconstruction and upgrading repairs. DDOT’s local roads are an integral part of the Districts infrastructure system. Residents, commuters, tourists, and those in the business community rely on DDOT for the city’s streets to be safe, reliable and functional, thus the maintenance of these roads is critical.",
    "progress_assessment": "DDOT develops an annual construction plan based on the approved budget. This construction plan serves not only as the plan for which a construction schedule is adhered to but the is made available to the public so that they can become aware of when DDOT will be in their community to begin construction.",

The central platform for the DC One Card is a card that contains one or more wireless devices (chips).",
    "justification": "This project is necessary because, by consolidating credentials citywide, the District will be able to reduce the resources it uses for card production and management, thus saving money government-wide. It also will provide substantial convenience to residents and easier access to government services.",

Additionally, it is too close to ODC1 for disaster recovery purposes. For less than the cost of the improvements and repairs, ODC2 can be moved to a state-of –the-art leased facility outside of the District of Columbia. This funding enhancement would close the gap between existing funding for a move and the estimated costs of elimnating the Data Center 2 entirely. The assumption of the funding request is that Data Center 2 would move to an existing facility deep in the Virginia or Maryland suburbs (25-30 miles outside the District). This would be a leased co-location facility with the lease covered by fixed costs. Alalysis of alternative sites is underway. Analysis of 'move' vendors is also beginning.",
    "justification": "This project is necessary and urgent because both data centers no longer have sufficient space and power available to meet current and future demands, their infrastructures are old and in need of costly major upgrades, and they are too close together for Disaster Recovery purposes. As the current data centers are only five (5) miles apart, a serious incident may affect both. Leasing a facility outside the District will mitigate this risk.",

This project will facilitate the relocation of the OCTO data centers to sites that are more secure, have robust infrastructure, and have sufficient capacity to meet current and future needs. The scope of the project is to find and prepare suitable data center sites, relocate the services to those sites, and support necessary capital improvements. One data center will be moved to a District-owned, recently constructed, highly secure site at the Unified Communications Center (UCC). The other data center will be moved to a state-of–the-art leased facility outside of the District of Columbia. Doing so will eliminate current issues with space and power capacity, as well as improve the District’s disaster recovery capability.",
    "justification": "This project is necessary and urgent because both data centers no longer have sufficient space and power available to meet current and future demands, their infrastructures are old and in need of costly major upgrades, and they are too close together for Disaster Recovery purposes. As the current data centers are only five (5) miles apart, a serious incident may affect both. Leasing a facility outside the District will mitigate this risk.",

High availability refers in this case to an uptime of 99.999% or better, or approximately five (5) minutes of downtime or less per year. OCTO is accomplishing this by building in redundancies across data centers, as well as replicating hardware and software to create an “active-active” configuration (meaning that both data center sites are in an “active” state, so that when one goes down all applications continue running). This project will consolidate our citywide messaging systems into the enterprise SAN. Citywide messaging is currently deploying a direct-attached storage (DAS) system for Microsoft Exchange 2007, a vendor-recommended architecture. By FY2015, we expect to be at the point of upgrading to the next version of Exchange, which is slated to support SAN architecture.",

CityDW gathers data and builds reporting environments for CapStat (http://capstat.oca.dc.gov/WhatIsCapStat.aspx) and agencies like CFSA, DDOT, OUC (311 and 991 data). CityDW also builds custom applications and dashboards to display the data like internal reporting and tracking tools like TrackDC (a public version will be released in FY10). CityDW being the centralized location for a large amount of city data is also charged with making the data available to the public. One example is the District’s Data Catalog that provides over 400 datasets in easy to access formats (spreadsheets Google Maps, Google Earth). For years the District of Columbia has provided public access to city operational data through the Internet to help agencies operate as more responsive, better performing organizations. The Data Catalog can be used to view or download a variety of data like crimes, service requests, procurements, permits, constructions projects, purchase card transactions, purchase orders and more.",

In addition, it will enable the use of self-service for all city employees and extend for the first time the use of the applications to include non-employees such as contractors and volunteers, eliminate paper forms, support 360-degree performance feedback and secure access for DC employees from outside DC’s network. This program implements a single enterprise wide software platform that will replace several DCHR IT legacy systems (HR Gateway, PMP, PES, ASPEN SumTotal, and paper/excel documents/reports). Operating costs are reduced by 1) eliminating DCHR’s IT support and maintenance costs for its stand-alone applications, 2) streamlining HR operations, and 3) reducing amount of printed paper. In FY 2010 Workforce Analytics will provide managers with the capability to perform complex analysis of the District’s workforce to assist in decisions about staffing, hiring and workforce deployment.",
    "justification": "The current version of PeopleSoft will no longer be supported by Oracle at the end of 2010. Essential legal, regulatory, and tax updates are delivered six times a year by Oracle. Therefore, the District must upgrade to a newer version of PeopleSoft to ensure receipt of these updates beyond 12/31/2010.",

The $71,000,00 in project funds available ($52,000,000 in the form of debt from John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company and $19,000,000 in the form of equity from Fannie Mae) were used to finance all of the hard and soft costs of the renovation of the Building as well as certain expenses related to the Council's move to and occupancy at One Judiciary Square. The District is working with the Wilson Building transaction participants to evaluate debt financings that would either lower the costs of capital on the existing deal or structure the new financing to permit the District Executive to reoccupy the building.  Specifically, the District may seek to issue bonds to (1) replace the taxable debt with tax exempt debt keeping the existing occupancy and legal structure in place, (2) refinance the taxable debt with tax-exempt debt, occupying the entire building and paying GSA the lease rental cost, and (3) refinance the taxable debt, repaying the building partners their project costs with tax-exempt debt and paying the debt service on the new debt.  Lease payment and/or debt service on this financing, if completed, has been allocated in the Repayment of Loans and Interest agency.  The District has included $75 million of capital budget authority in this CIP in order to refinance the John Hancock debt if the District can derive a sufficient financial benefit from the transaction.",

The tax system modernization will be achieved in stages to replace individual components starting with the case management module, real property system, and eventually the core tax management system.    This project represents a modernization of the Integrated Tax System (ITS). The current system will require a technology refresh, particularly on the reporting and middle-ware tools, to take advantage of web-based technologies that were not available when the system was installed. This will require replacement of the SAND and the Crystal server-based systems currently in use for report and query building , as well as supporting platform software and related applications. This investment will allow the core underlying system to remain in place, while simplifying maintenance requirements and allowing for further consolidation of servers and reduced bandwidth requirements.",
    "justification": "The first phase is to replace the real property tax module, to address and reduce the risk of fraud and mismanagement by leveraging superior internal controls and industry best practices implemented in the replacement system.  In addition, the new case management system will provide intelligent case analytics, review, and analysis abilities that will result in increased tax compliance and collections, resulting in increased revenues.  The implementation of the Phase 1 will result in the capture of new tax revenue that will be recognized as Paygo transfers from the general fund to the capital fund in the amount of $11.5 million in FY2014 - FY2016.  This capital budget will help to offset the project costs.",

    "description": "This project involves the interior renovation of the 1930s era building to create a 21st century state-of-art LEED Silver Rated facility.   The scope of work entails providing architectural and engineering services including predesign, design, preparation of contract documents, commissioning and  planning services to substantially renovate the structure to fully comply with ADA Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities (September 2002) and to bring the building up to all current building codes.  This includes vertical transportation, interior circulation, signage, entrances and exists, walkways, restrooms, alarms, etc.  The renovation will make the facility more engery efficient and will provide improved library services to the community.      The Northeast Neighborhood Library has recently undergone exterior improvements that restored the historic doors and windows, tuck-pointed the masonry, and created a landscaped reading garden. This work was Phase 1 of a two-phase project approach. Similar phased approaches have been undertaken at Petworth and Mount Pleasant libraries. The interior improvements at Northeast have been submitted as part of the Libraries Capital Improvement Plan beginning in FY 2009. In FY 2009 and FY 2010 funding requested for this project was postponed to out-years and in FY 2011 removed completely from the Capital Improvement Plan. Based on December 2010 Facility Condition Report, the Northeast Library is not up to current building codes and is not in compliance with ADA/ADAAG requirements.  The interior renovation project includes funding for temporary interim library facilities.",

The facility will meet the needs outlined in the five Focus Areas of Library Activity envisioned by DCPL, as follows:  service to children and teens; library as a community place; books and other library materials; technology; and adult literacy and learning. The project will also consist of providing between 3,500 to 5,000 Square Feet of interim/temporary/swing space in order to assure continues library services during construction activities.   The new Palisades neighborhood library will reflect the program and goals of the Library and the needs of the District of Columbia residents that use the library. The building will incorporate forward-thinking approaches to urban design, architecture, engineering, environmental technologies in the public realm. The new Palisades Library will be a destination that will attract and support hundreds of users a day, and promote a vibrant, mixed-use neighborhood and active street environment. The new library will have an iconic architectural presence befitting its location in the community, yet be reflective of the city's modern growth and new innovations in building design and technology. The library design will be unique in the nation's capitol, and representative of 21st century architectural ideals. A building condition assessment was conducted in 2001 and an additional building assessment completed December 2009. The 2001 report indicated close to $800,000 (in 2001 dollars) worth on repairs and upgrades; this work has never been done in it entirety.

The community that use the Palisades Library will benefit from expanded library services much in the same way citizens in Wards 7 and 2 have benefited from their recently opened new libraries.

The subproject consists of acquisition, assemblage, site preparations, and demolition and stabilization of property to promote housing, affordable housing, and economic development opportunities. Projects for acquisition are identified in areas where the District can make an investment to enhance and complement development projects being undertaken by the private or non-profit sectors, as well as neighborhoods with substantial concentrations of vacant and abandoned property. Acquisition methods include friendly sales, tax foreclosures, and eminent domain. Included are technical studies, appraisals, environmental assessments, title reviews, and other acquisition expenses, in addition to the actual cost of acquisition of real property. Also included are costs of demolition, site improvements and other site preparation costs associated with acquisitions of real property. Finally, once the property is owned by the District, this project pays for costs related to the rehabilitation and the stabilization of the real property, including but not limited to engineering and/or architectural reports and drawings, as well as the development of solicitation for offers. Disposition methods include solicitations for offers, auctions of scattered sites, a combination solicitation and lottery for developers and homebuyers, as well as negotiated sales.  Future budget allotment will be paygo capital budget.  The program will work closely with DCRA project for the abatement of vacant and blighted property.",

    "description": "New Communities is a partnership between residents of distressed communities and the District.  The goal is to transform the communities into viable places for existing and new residents to live, work, learn and recreate in a safe, healthy, and pleasant environment.  Lincoln Heights/Richardson Dwellings is one of four New Communities sites in the District.  The physical area will be redeveloped into a mixed-use, mixed-income community with an estimated 1,609 new on and offsite housing units, retail, office, a new swimming pool as part of the recreational facility at Kelly Miller Middle School, and the HD Woodson High School.   DMPED is utilizing New Communities capital funds to facilitate development of approximately 630 on- and off-site replacement housing units as part of this revitalization effort. The replacement units will be affordable to existing public housing residents who currently live in the Lincoln Heights (440) and Richardson Dwellings (190) public housing developments and who pay no more than 30% of their income for housing.",
    "justification": "These funds are needed in order to assist with the capital activities required to undertake a comprehensive redevelopment of this area plagued by high crime, high poverty and aging public housing.  Capital funds make up a small amount of the total development budget; however, the capital funds are necessary in order to leverage the other financing tools that are needed and which the District plans to pursue such as private capital, bond financing, tax credits, land and other equity.",
    "progress_assessment": "The project is on track, and DMPED is in the process of identifying off-site replacement housing properties.",

The present facility is inadequate to meet the changing demands of its service area. The building was not originally designed to accommodate the number of personnel currently assigned and is in need of an addition to provide adequate working conditions. The scope of this project will include the construction of a 3,000 sq. ft. addition, the  replacement of HVAC units, electrical and plumbing systems.  Fire alarms and protections will be installed in compliance with fire and life safety codes along with a new ADA compliant public restroom, sleeping quarters, showers, bathrooms, locker rooms, and a kitchen.  Additionally, the project will include the installation of strip heaters in an apparatus bay and a residential washer and dryer rack.  A biohazard decontamination area will be installed to comply with federal regulations.  The facility will also have extensive concrete replacement, refurbishment or replacement windows and doors, a renovated basement, repairs to its brick exterior structure and an upgraded drainage system.",

Simulators will include remotely controlled, propane gas fired props to simulate automobile fires, gas meter fires, and flammable liquid spill fires securely mounted on a concrete pad with appropriate emergency shut off devices installed. The project will also include the construction of a fire extinguisher training area with a code compliant extinguishing agent containment/recycling system, a large concrete pad with appropriate props for safely conducting automobile extrication training, and a concrete simulation of a trench excavation to be used for cave-in/collapse rescue training.",

The SLED will be the main repository of the District of Columbia’s current and historical public education  student, teacher, and school data. The data will be used for education planning, analysis, research, and reporting. The SLED will be populated with information extracted from disparate enterprise educational systems into a single comprehensive relational database. It will standardize student academic information currently stored in various local education agencies (LEAs) and it will track student information statewide over multiple years and across education institutions. Once built, the SLED will enable the sharing of critical information that tracks student learning spanning early care and education, K-12 programs, post-secondary, and adult education. It will ultimately link to other youth and adult serving institutions to provide a comprehensive picture of the District of Columbia’s learners.",
    "justification": "To continue qualifying and competing for federal funds, OSSE must demonstrate its capacity to link or its plans to link student information across pre-school, K-12 and postsecondary education, as well as workforce data.  As a 2007 recipient of $5,700,000 in federal grant funds to build a state longitudinal data system, OSSE must also fulfill the terms of the grant agreement to keep the funds and avoid default.",

    "description": "The District’s lighting assets are critical to the safety of District’s residents and visitors.  These assets are also essential for the well-being of businesses, commuters, and pedestrians.     DDOT entered into a five-year performance-based contract with an electrical contractor to maintain the District’s lighting assets.  The contractor is responsible for managing all lighting assets within public space, including alleys and streetlights, highways, underpasses, tunnels, bridges, navigation lights, overhead guide signs, and “Welcome to Washington, DC” signs.  A number of lighting systems and the electrical control systems for the Frederick Douglas Bridge are also included.      In this performance-based asset preservation contract, the desired outcome is specified rather than the means and methods: the contractor is instructed what to achieve, not how to achieve it.  The District requires that the contractor meet a set of performance standards for all assets and DDOT personnel conduct citywide monthly and annual inspections to measure the contractor’s performance.  DDOT personnel also monitor the contractor’s response for repair requests and schedules daily.  The contract includes both incentives and disincentives for failing or exceeding these performance measures.  The asset contractor has improved the lighting performance by reducing outages from a high of 20 percent two years ago (FY07) to less one percent this year (FY09).",
    "justification": "This project is necessary for the safety of District residents and drivers.  The performance-based contract has proven to be the most cost-effective way to ensure that the District’s streetlights are illuminating the streets.    In FY 2008, 1,400 streetlights were repaired and 900 alley lights were upgraded through this project.  Funding is necessary to continue this type of maintenance, repairs, and upgrades.",
    "progress_assessment": "The contract is progressing as planned. This contract has improved the District’s lighting system by reducing outages and other unsafe conditions thus resulting in improved customer satisfaction as compared to previous years.",

This program not only supports major safety initiatives, it offsets potential claims associated with faulty or faded signage.",

District taxpayers benefit from the enhanced safety measures of the installation of new signage and the replacement of faded signage.  The project began in 2003 to improve signs on District’s streets and alleys.  The project makes neighborhoods safer and more pedestrian friendly.    In FY2008, 20,316 signs were installed, 8,284 signs were repaired, 26,000 temporary signs were installed, and 14,130 signs were fabricated.  Funding must continue so that DDOT can continue this work that improves safety for both vehicles and pedestrians.",

    "description": "The District of Columbia has over 682 local roadway miles that require preservation, maintenance, and repair.  The District Department of Transportation (DDOT) has developed an annual work (construction) schedule that continuously assesses the needs of every local street in the District.  Depending on the condition of the roadway, DDOT will provide service from basic mill and overlay (for resurfacing needs) to complete reconstruction and upgrade.  Regardless of the construction type, DDOT’s focus is to also repair or replace the adjacent sidewalks, curbs, and gutters in conjunction to the street repair, if applicable. In addition, DDOT has established a ward based contract which allows timely and successful implementation and execution of work plans.  Annual work (construction) plans are based on the available funding and fulfill the Mayor's initiatives and objectives and benefits the residents as well.    There is a separate road reconstruction project for each ward.",
    "justification": "DDOT’s goal is to preserve our current roadway system and provide maintenance as needed.  This service helps to avoid the more costly reconstruction and upgrading repairs. DDOT’s local roads are an integral part of the Districts infrastructure system.  Residents, commuters, tourists, and those in the business community rely on DDOT for the city’s streets to be safe, reliable and functional, thus the maintenance of these roads is critical.",
    "progress_assessment": "DDOT develops an annual construction plan based on the approved budget.  This construction plan serves not only as the plan for which a construction schedule is adhered to but the is made available to the public so that they can become aware of when DDOT will be in their community to begin construction.",

OCTO coordinates and facilitates cross-agency investments through the District of Columbia Geographic Information System (DC GIS) Steering Committee.  OCTO supports these cross-agency activities by providing technical expertise and paying for a portion of the cross-agency projects. OCTO also supports individual agencies to enhance the District’s current base map to add agency-specific information.",

The DC GIS is already utilized across the government, and the data and applications are the basis of many government operations and decisions. DC GIS works with numerous agencies to make District agencies better stewards of our environment, be more prepared for emergencies, improve public safety, be more efficient in our government operations, track our assets and projects, be more competitive and careful in our economic development, and to be more thorough and fair in our revenue collection.",

This project will facilitate the relocation of the OCTO data centers to sites that are more secure, have robust infrastructure, and have sufficient capacity to meet current and future needs. The scope of the project is to find and prepare suitable data center sites, relocate the services to those sites, and support necessary capital improvements. One data center will remain in a leased facility. The other data center will be moved to a state-of–the-art leased facility outside of the District of Columbia. Doing so eliminates current issues with space and power capacity, as well as improves the District’s disaster recovery capability.",

CityDW works the City Administrator, DCStat and with District agencies to supply data, business intelligence tools and dashboards.  CityDW gathers data and builds reporting environments for DCStat (http://capstat.oca.dc.gov/DC.aspx) and agencies like CFSA, DDOT, OUC (311 and 991 data).  CityDW also builds custom applications and dashboards to display the data like internal reporting and tracking tools like TrackDC (a public version will be released in FY10).   CityDW being the centralized location for a large amount of city data is also charged with making the data available to the public.  One example is the District’s Data Catalog that provides over 400 datasets in easy to access formats (spreadsheets Google Maps, Google Earth).  For years the District of Columbia has provided public access to city operational data through the Internet to help agencies operate as more responsive, better performing organizations. The Data Catalog can be used to view or download a variety of data like crimes, service requests, procurements, permits, constructions projects, purchase card transactions, purchase orders and more.",

A key feature of this project will be the construction of a new and architecturally significant Frederick Douglass Memorial/South Capitol Street Bridge. This structure will spark the transformation of the South Capitol Street corridor and create a world class gateway between the east and west sides of the Anacostia River. Additional park lands will be created in the area adjacent to the new bridge to promote liveable communities, expand recreational options, and reconnect the city to the Anacostia riverfront. Economic development opportunities will be created and improved connectivity for residents will be provided to federal installations and job centers, including enhanced access to the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Navy Yard, Bolling Air Force Base, the Anacostia Annex, and Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland.",

The 11th Street Bridges design build project represents a significant step forward in DDOT ’s Anacostia Waterfront Initiative infrastructure endeavor. The project will improve mobility by providing separate freeway and local traffic connections to area roadways. Providing these connections will allow for the creation of the  “Grand Urban Boulevard” envisioned for the South Capitol Street Corridor. The project provides multi-modal transportation options for cars, pedestrians, bicycles, and the future DC Streetcar; replaces existing structures that are both functionally deficient and structurally obsolete; provides an additional alternate evacuation route from our Nation’s Capital; and supports the overall environmental mission of the Anacostia Waterfront Initiative. The first phase of the innovative design build to budget project started construction in December 2009, and is scheduled to be completed in 2013. This project is the largest project ever completed by DDOT and is the first river bridge replacement in the District of Columbia in more than 40 years. Completing this project will improve travel for both local and regional traffic.",

    "justification": "The project will achieve a full system upgrade of all major components of the District’s General Ledger system.  The current District General Ledger system is based on 20 year old technology.  Supporting this technology is becoming ever more complicated since the resources and skill-sets needed to support a mainframe based system are not easily available.  Moreover, the current General Ledger system lacks functionality found in modern systems necessary to support real-time financial management and allow the OCFO to provide greater integration with other key District systems such as the cash management system, budgeting systems, Human Resources and Payroll systems, and the tax systems.",

    "description": "This project will completely modernize and refine the District’s tax systems to bring them in line with industry best practices and add new functionality in the areas of compliance, collections, case management and individual, business and property tax collection, processing and accounting. The tax system modernization will be achieved in stages to replace individual components starting with the case management module, real property system, and eventually the core tax management system.    This project represents a modernization of the Integrated Tax System (ITS). The current system will require a technology refresh, particularly on the reporting and middle-ware tools, to take advantage of web-based technologies that were not available when the system was installed. This will require replacement of the SAND and the Crystal server-based systems currently in use for report and query building , as well as supporting platform software and related applications. This investment will allow the core underlying system to remain in place, while simplifying maintenance requirements and allowing for further consolidation of servers and reduced bandwidth requirements.",
    "justification": "The first phase is to replace the real property tax module, to address and reduce the risk of fraud and mismanagement by leveraging superior internal controls and industry best practices implemented in the replacement system.  In addition, the new case management system will provide intelligent case analytics, review, and analysis abilities that will result in increased tax compliance and collections, resulting in increased revenues.  The implementation of the Phase 1 will result in the capture of new tax revenue that will be recognized as Paygo transfers from the general fund to the capital fund in the amount of $11.5 million in FY2014 - FY2016.  This capital budget will help to offset the project costs.",
    "progress_assessment": "The project is currently in the planning phase and high-level designs of all the different projects within the modernization initiative are being developed.  The District’s project manager for this effort has been hired.  Currently, requirements are being collected for the case management and real property tax system modules.",

The Library lacks the funding for a total renovation and therefore has implemented strategic projects that improve services, modernize the space while being respectful of  the historic nature of the building.  A new and reconfigured Business, Science and Technology Division will localize over 100 public access computers to this division. The project also includes funding to relocate/create new eBIC space on the seldom used A-Level. The A-Level renovation will provide flexible space permitting multiple uses for either Library programming,  eBIC, University of the District of Columbia, Community College of DC as well being available for community use.",

The scope of work entails providing architectural and engineering services including predesign, design, preparation of contract documents, commissioning and  planning services to substantially renovate the structure to fully comply with ADA Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities (September 2002) and to bring the building up to all current building codes.  This includes vertical transportation, interior circulation, signage, entrances and exists, walkways, restrooms, alarms, etc.  The renovation will make the facility more engery efficient and will provide improved library services to the community.      The Northeast Neighborhood Library has recently undergone exterior improvements that restored the historic doors and windows, tuck-pointed the masonry, and created a landscaped reading garden. This work was Phase 1 of a two-phase project approach. Similar phased approaches have been undertaken at Petworth and Mount Pleasant libraries. The interior improvements at Northeast have been submitted as part of the Libraries Capital Improvement Plan beginning in FY 2009. In FY 2009 and FY 2010 funding requested for this project was postponed to out-years and in FY 2011 removed completely from the Capital Improvement Plan. Based on December 2010 Facility Condition Report, the Northeast Library is not up to current building codes and is not in compliance with ADA/ADAAG requirements.  The interior renovation project includes funding for temporary interim library facilities.",

Projects for acquisition are identified in areas where the District can make an investment to enhance and complement development projects being undertaken by the private or non-profit sectors, as well as neighborhoods with substantial concentrations of vacant and abandoned property. Acquisition methods include friendly sales, tax foreclosures, and eminent domain. Included are technical studies, appraisals, environmental assessments, title reviews, and other acquisition expenses, in addition to the actual cost of acquisition of real property. Also included are costs of demolition, site improvements and other site preparation costs associated with acquisitions of real property. Finally, once the property is owned by the District, this project pays for costs related to the rehabilitation and the stabilization of the real property, including but not limited to engineering and/or architectural reports and drawings, as well as the development of solicitation for offers. Disposition methods include solicitations for offers, auctions of scattered sites, a combination solicitation and lottery for developers and homebuyers, as well as negotiated sales.

Under BRAC law, each LRA is required to submit its reuse and homeless plan to HUD 270 days from submission deadline for all notices of interest.  For WRAMC, that deadline in November 30, 2010.      Successful implementation of the plan will result in an integration of this 60+ acres into the community making the over 40+ acres of green/open space available to the community.

The interior of this historic building will be redesigned and all of the building’s electrical and lighting systems and plumbing will be replaced to the Silver level of the LEED standard for renovations.  The storm water management system will be replaced.  Working with the Historic Preservation Office, FEMS will widen the apparatus bay door to accomodate the larger apparatus FEMS will be required to purchase to meet the 2010 EPA Clean Emissions Standard and all windows will be replaced with energy efficient windows that match the original ones.  A temporary fire station will provide uninterrupted protection to the community during this project.",

However, in order for the sytem to perform in accordance with the design parameters and deliver the requisite amount of air in the cellblocks, additional fine tuning is necessary; four large rooftop duct fittings need to be replaced, transitions from the large rooftop units need to be modified and final air and water balancing needs to be done for the system to work properly.

The interface with JUSTIS is designed to accept only specific data variables from the court, which are then transferred into the agency’s database and web application.  This data transfer system was designed in 2005, and provides for a daily transfer of individual case disposition and sentencing related data.  The Commission annually receives offender and offense related data from approximately 4,300 felony counts.  Data is initially transferred when a case disposition occurs and then updated when a sentence is imposed.  Thus, there are approximately 10,000 data transmissions from the court to the Commission annually.  This data has enabled the Commission to determine judicial compliance, analyze sentencing trends and evaluate the effectiveness of the sentencing guidelines.  It is from this data that the agency creates its Annual Reports, Issues Papers and responses to various data requests from criminal justice professionals.  Data analysis is the core function of the agency and it is the source of information from which modifications to the guidelines are developed and implemented as required in D.C. Code §3-101(b)(2)-(6).    DCSC will be implementing a new Integrated Justice Information System (IJIS) Outbound 12.1.  This will replace the RAM Server—the technology by which data from the court is now transferred—with the new IJIS Broker.  Currently, agencies pull data directly from the Agency Database; however, after the implementation of IJIS Outbound 12.1, agencies will pull data directly from JUSTIS and the agency database will cease to function as it is currently constructed.  In addition, JUSTIS will use an XML to facilitate a full data transfer from the court without any filtering.  The RAM Server and Agency Database are scheduled to be shut down six months after the IJIS Outbound 12.1 is fully implemented, which should tentatively occur in late 2012 or early 2013.  At that time, if agencies have not made the necessary changes to their respective data systems, they will no longer receive data from the court.    The Commission will be required to change its interface with JUSTIS to accept unfiltered data elements and transfer the data to a Staging Database from which the necessary and required data elements can be transferred to the agency’s database and web application.  Currently, the agency does not utilize a staging database and will need to construct one.  In addition, the amount of data available through IJIS Outbound 12.1 will increase significantly and the current agency web application was not constructed to process unfiltered data.  Further, changes will need to be made to the agency’s web application to utilize the additional data being provided.      If funding is not available to make the required changes to maintain compatibility with IJIS Outbound 12.1 and the Commission can no longer receive sentencing data from the court, the agency will be unable to meet any of its statutory duties.",

Facility components such as roofs, boilers, and windows are failing, and costly maintenance procedures are unable to correct these problems. Costs increase as these deficiencies continue and the ability of the school to deliver quality curriculum in the classrooms is diminished. This project will also eliminate the many facility emergencies that occur as the result of years of deferred maintenance. The improvements will be accomplished through a revitalization of all major systems and components including roofs, windows and frames, exterior and interior doors and frames, exterior walls, site work, interior finishes, electrical, mechanical, life-safety equipment and compliance with legislative requirements, including health and safety issues and the Americans with Disabilities Act(ADA).",

The SLED will be the main repository of the District of Columbia’s current and historical public education  student, teacher, and school data. The data will be used for education planning, analysis, research, and reporting. The SLED will be populated with information extracted from disparate enterprise educational systems into a single comprehensive relational database. It will standardize student academic information currently stored in various local education agencies (LEAs) and it will track student information statewide over multiple years and across education institutions. Once built, the SLED will enable the sharing of critical information that tracks student learning spanning early care and education, K-12 programs, post-secondary, and adult education. It will ultimately link to other youth and adult serving institutions to provide a comprehensive picture of the District of Columbia’s learners.",

An integrated approach would allow a citizen to find out about the available District and federal resources available to them through a wide variety of programs and providers. Multiple agencies throughout the District serve the same families, children and adults, often at the same time through separately maintained systems and infrastructures.

These assets are also essential for the well-being of businesses, commuters, and pedestrians.     DDOT's multi-year performance-based contract maintains the District's lighting assets.  The contractor is responsible for managing all lighting assets within public space, including alleys and streetlights, highways, underpasses, tunnels, bridges, navigation lights, overhead guide signs, and “Welcome to Washington, DC” signs.  A number of lighting systems and the electrical control systems for the Frederick Douglas Bridge are also included.      In this performance-based asset preservation contract, the desired outcome is specified rather than the means and methods: the contractor is instructed what to achieve, not how to achieve it.  The District requires that the contractor meet a set of performance standards for all assets and DDOT personnel conduct citywide monthly and annual inspections to measure the contractor’s performance.  DDOT personnel also monitor the contractor’s response for repair requests and schedules daily.  The contract includes both incentives and disincentives for failing or exceeding these performance measures.  The asset contractor has improved the lighting performance by reducing outages from a high of 20 percent two years ago (FY07) to less one percent this year (FY09).     This project also includes upgrades to lighting assets, including the conversion of traditional lighting to high efficiency LED technology. The project also funds staff who implement this program.",

    "description": "The District Department of Transportation (DDOT) began construction of 11th Street Bridge Project in December 2009 to replace the two existing bridges with three new bridges and improve the related interchanges. When completed in mid-2013, the project will:    • Improve mobility by providing separate freeway and local traffic connections to both directions of DC 295, the Southeast-Southwest Freeway and local streets on both sides of the Anacostia River,   • Provide a shared path for pedestrians and bicycles, as well as rails to allow future streetcar connections,   • Replace the existing functionally deficient and structurally obsolete bridges,   • Provide an additional alternate evacuation route from our Nation’s Capital, and   • Include new trail connections, improved drainage and other environmental investments.   Projected to serve almost 180,000 vehicles per day by 2030, the existing bridges lack connections to allow travel directly from southbound DC 295/Anacostia Freeway to the Southeast-Southwest Freeway or from the Southeast-Southwest Freeway to northbound DC 295. The two new freeway bridges will provide these connections. The third bridge will carry local traffic between city streets on both sides of the river and provide additional connections to both directions of DC 295.  The project is the largest ever constructed by DDOT and is the first river bridge replacement in the District in more than 40 years.",

    "description": "The District of Columbia has over 682 local roadway miles that require preservation, maintenance, and repair.  The District Department of Transportation (DDOT) has developed an annual work (construction) schedule that continuously assesses the needs of every local street in the District.  Depending on the condition of the roadway, DDOT will provide service from basic mill and overlay (for resurfacing needs) to complete reconstruction and upgrade.  Regardless of the construction type, DDOT’s focus is to also repair or replace the adjacent sidewalks, curbs, and gutters in conjunction to the street repair, if applicable. In addition, DDOT has established a ward based contract which allows timely and successful implementation and execution of work plans.  Annual work (construction) plans are based on the available funding and fulfill the Mayor's initiatives and objectives and benefits the residents as well.    There is a separate road reconstruction project for each ward.",
    "justification": "DDOT’s goal is to preserve our current roadway system and provide maintenance as needed.  This service helps to avoid the more costly reconstruction and upgrading repairs. DDOT’s local roads are an integral part of the Districts infrastructure system.  Residents, commuters, tourists, and those in the business community rely on DDOT for the city’s streets to be safe, reliable and functional, thus the maintenance of these roads is critical.",
    "progress_assessment": "DDOT develops an annual construction plan based on the approved budget.  This construction plan serves not only as the plan for which a construction schedule is adhered to but the is made available to the public so that they can become aware of when DDOT will be in their community to begin construction.",

These enhancements can be grouped into the following categories:    Product Enhancements (Application Functionality) – these enhancements cover the spectrum of costs associated with the changes necessary to further align the system to meet clinical practices and includes enhancements to system screens, reports, features and functionality that require alteration to comply with regulatory requirements (as stated by the Department of Justice), workflow changes, process documentation, process optimization or any mix of these as well upgrading to RADPlus 2011      Equipment – in the form of signature pads.  Approximately twenty of these devices have already been put in place allowing the hospital to apply electronic signatures to electronic forms furthering the development of a fully digital EMR.    Avatar Management Reports – the hospital seeks to have qualified Crystal Reports designers create a series of complex reports surrounding the timeliness of completing assessments.    Additional detail and specifications are located in Appendix B, Management Report Specs.    Future Form/Enhancement and Report Development – The hospital will continue to work with the DOJ and other regulatory agencies to fulfill its compliance obligations.  Based on past meetings with these regulatory bodies, requests for new forms or changes to existing forms will be mandated.  Further, based on the dynamic nature of the hospital, as it optimizes its own processes, it is essential that funding be made available to allow for forms and/or enhancements that are as yet unidentified.",

    "description": "The Citywide Data Warehouse’s (CityDW) mission is to democratize government data by providing a centralized access point for enterprise-wide data with a focus on data that enables decision support and government transparency. CityDW works the City Administrator, DCStat and with District agencies to supply data, business intelligence tools and dashboards.  CityDW gathers data and builds reporting environments for DCStat (http://capstat.oca.dc.gov/DC.aspx) and agencies like CFSA, DDOT, OUC (311 and 991 data).  CityDW also builds custom applications and dashboards to display the data like internal reporting and tracking tools like TrackDC (a public version will be released in FY10).   CityDW being the centralized location for a large amount of city data is also charged with making the data available to the public.  One example is the District’s Data Catalog that provides over 400 datasets in easy to access formats (spreadsheets Google Maps, Google Earth).  For years the District of Columbia has provided public access to city operational data through the Internet to help agencies operate as more responsive, better performing organizations. The Data Catalog can be used to view or download a variety of data like crimes, service requests, procurements, permits, constructions projects, purchase card transactions, purchase orders and more.",
    "justification": "Information is one of the most under-utilized assets in government. Without the proper data sharing in place, agencies often bear all costs associated with collecting, storing, and protecting data without realizing any noticeable benefits. CityDW gathers and makes this data available to the Office of the City Administrator, agencies, employees and citizens. CityDW was selected from over 700 applicants by the Ash Institute as the winner of the 2009 Innovations in American Government Award in Urban Policy.",
    "progress_assessment": "CityDW now publishes over 400 datasets via the Data Catalog (http://data.octo.dc.gov/), and built four applications that are available to the public that make it easy to access and view data including crime and service requests on a map.",

This program will upgrade the PeopleSoft suite and implement the performance management and management end-user reporting tools.  In addition, it will enable the use of self-service for all city employees and extend for the first time the use of the applications to include non-employees such as contractors and volunteers, eliminate paper forms, support 360-degree performance feedback and secure access for DC employees from outside DC’s network. This program implements a single enterprise wide software platform that will replace several DCHR IT legacy systems (HR Gateway, PMP, PES, ASPEN SumTotal, and paper/excel documents/reports). Operating costs are reduced by 1) eliminating DCHR’s IT support and maintenance costs for its stand-alone applications, 2) streamlining HR operations, and 3) reducing amount of printed paper.  In FY 2010 Workforce Analytics will provide managers with the capability to perform complex analysis of the District’s workforce to assist in decisions about staffing, hiring and workforce deployment.",

A key feature of this project will be the construction of a new and architecturally significant Frederick Douglass Memorial/South Capitol Street Bridge. This structure will spark the transformation of the South Capitol Street corridor and create a world class gateway between the east and west sides of the Anacostia River. Additional park lands will be created in the area adjacent to the new bridge to promote liveable communities, expand recreational options, and reconnect the city to the Anacostia riverfront. Economic development opportunities will be created and improved connectivity for residents will be provided to federal installations and job centers, including enhanced access to the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Navy Yard, Bolling Air Force Base, the Anacostia Annex, and Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland.",

The 11th Street Bridges design build project represents a significant step forward in DDOT ’s Anacostia Waterfront Initiative infrastructure endeavor. The project will improve mobility by providing separate freeway and local traffic connections to area roadways. Providing these connections will allow for the creation of the  “Grand Urban Boulevard” envisioned for the South Capitol Street Corridor. The project provides multi-modal transportation options for cars, pedestrians, bicycles, and the future DC Streetcar; replaces existing structures that are both functionally deficient and structurally obsolete; provides an additional alternate evacuation route from our Nation’s Capital; and supports the overall environmental mission of the Anacostia Waterfront Initiative. The first phase of the innovative design build to budget project started construction in December 2009, and is scheduled to be completed in 2013. This project is the largest project ever completed by DDOT and is the first river bridge replacement in the District of Columbia in more than 40 years. Completing this project will improve travel for both local and regional traffic.",

    "description": "This project will completely modernize and refine the District’s tax systems to bring them in line with industry best practices and add new functionality in the areas of compliance, collections, case management,   individual, business and property tax collection; and processing and accounting. The tax system modernization will be achieved in stages to replace individual components starting with the case management module, real property system, and eventually the core tax management system.    This project represents a modernization of the Integrated Tax System (ITS). The current system will require a technology refresh, particularly on the reporting and middle-ware tools, to take advantage of web-based technologies that were not available when the system was installed. This will require replacement of the SAND and the Crystal server-based systems currently in use for report and query building as well as supporting platform software and related applications. This investment will allow the core underlying system to remain in place, while simplifying maintenance requirements and allowing for further consolidation of servers and reduced bandwidth requirements.",
    "justification": "The first phase is to replace the real property tax module, to address and reduce the risk of fraud and mismanagement by leveraging superior internal controls and industry best practices implemented in the replacement system.  In addition, the new case management system will provide intelligent case analytics; and review and analysis abilities that will result in increased tax compliance and collections, further resulting in increased revenues.  The implementation of the Phase 1 will result in the capture of new tax revenue that will be recognized as Paygo transfers from the general fund to the capital fund in the amount of $11.5 million in FY2014 - FY2016.  This capital budget will help to offset the project costs.",
    "progress_assessment": "The project is currently in the planning phase and high-level designs of all the different projects within the modernization initiative are being developed.  The District’s project manager for this effort has been hired.  Currently, requirements are being collected for the case management and real property tax system modules.",

The project will also consist of providing between 3,500 to 5,000 square feet of interim/temporary/swing space in order to assure continued library services during construction activities. The new Palisades Neighborhood Library will reflect the program and goals of the library and the needs of the District of Columbia residents that use it.

Utilization of FY 2008 and FY 2009 Capital dollars to assist with predevelopment activities, to facilitate acquisition/construction activities, and/or to provide a direct subsidy for affordable housing replacement units to be created through the private and nonprofit sectors under Phase I of the New Communities Implementation Strategy.   Phase I is estimated to result in the creation of approximately 3,500 mixed-income housing units, including an estimated 900 affordable replacement units, across all 4 New Communities. Each plan includes three parts: (1) Physical Strategy to guide implementation of the area’s physical redevelopment; (2) Financial Strategy to fund the redevelopment activities; and (3) Human Capital to provide existing residents with support services.",
    "justification": "This project includes the comprehensive redevelopment of neighborhoods with high concentrations of low income housing and high rates of crimes.  The projects replace low density single use housing with stable neighborhood anchors such as schools, community centers, neighborhood servicing retail to create sustainable safe mixed income mixed use community.",

It will benefit the District taxpayers by lowering response times to the northern portion of Engine 22's response area and by allowing the members of Engine 22 to work and live in a modern, safe and efficient fire station. This project supports the Mayor's priorities by moving Engine 22, Truck 11 and Ambulance 22 further north and reducing response times in the northern portion of their response area.

The interior of this historic building will be redesigned and all of the building’s electrical, lighting systems and plumbing will be replaced to the Silver level of the LEED standard for renovations.  The storm water management system will be replaced.  Working with the Historic Preservation Office, FEMS will widen the apparatus bay door to accomodate the larger apparatus FEMS will be required to purchase to meet the 2010 EPA Clean Emissions Standard.  All windows will be replaced with energy efficient windows that match the original ones.  A temporary fire station will provide uninterrupted protection to the community during this project.",

It does not comply with current basic standards such as ADA access, NFPA standards for Fire Stations, and female firefighter locker room accommodations.

Simulators will include remotely controlled, propane gas fired props to simulate automobile fires, gas meter fires, and flammable liquid spill fires securely mounted on a concrete pad with appropriate emergency shut off devices installed. The project will also include the construction of a fire extinguisher training area with a code compliant extinguishing agent containment/recycling system, a large concrete pad with appropriate props for safely conducting automobile extrication training, and a concrete simulation of a trench excavation to be used for cave-in/collapse rescue training.",

However, in order for the sytem to perform in accordance with the design parameters and deliver the requisite amount of air in the cellblocks, additional fine tuning is necessary; four large rooftop duct fittings need to be replaced, transitions from the large rooftop units need to be modified and final air and water balancing needs to be done for the system to work properly.

    "description": "DCPS has set a goal to modernize the IT infrastructure at the Schools so that all students and staff have access to a high-speed, reliable, and secure network. Schools need to have 100% wireless coverage in all teaching and administrative areas, and each classroom should have active network drops to support any device plugged into them (printers, PC's, interactive whiteboards, etc.).  Seventy schools have or will be modernized by the 2014 - 2015 school year. Thirty - three more schools desperately need new routers, new switches, power upgrades, cabling work and new wireless Access Points (AP's) installed to be modernized by the 2-15 - 2016 school year. DC-Net analyzed all of the network equipment components and identified those components at the end of their useful life cycle, thus needing replacement. This aging equipment fails often, is costly to maintain, and gets in the way of establishing the wireless network needed by the Schools.",

District citizens and families that find themselves in need of support or help are often the least able to help themselves negotiate the maze of agencies to find and enroll in the appropriate programs. They are often required to travel between several offices and provide a variety of documents to prove their eligibility for services. An integrated approach would allow a citizen to find out about the available District and federal resources available to them through a wide variety of programs and providers.

It is anticipated that by 2030 a comprehensive streetcar network will operate in conjunction with the Circulator, Metro Extra rapid bus, and bus rapid transit to complement the current Metro bus and rail system. Current funding levels are based on a first phase 22 mile system and will support the completion of the H Street NE to Benning Rd NE and the intersection of Minnesota Av NW, along with the extension west to Washington Circle and into Georgetown. Funding is also in place to support a study of the streetcar line from Maine Av SW to Takoma Station, NW; and engineering of the historic Anacostia line to cross the 11th Street Bridge and proceed west to Buzzard Point. This includes predevelopment activities including the acquisition of rights-of-way, land and such other rights as may be needed for implementation of this project, and the purchase of streetcar vehicles.",

Surface transit options are needed to complement the Metro system and connect all District neighborhoods with efficient, reliable and affordable means of public transportation.

    "description": "The District of Columbia has over 682 local roadway miles that require preservation, maintenance, and repair.  The District Department of Transportation (DDOT) has developed an annual work (construction) schedule that continuously assesses the needs of every local street in the District.  Depending on the condition of the roadway, DDOT will provide service from basic mill and overlay (for resurfacing needs) to complete reconstruction and upgrade.  Regardless of the construction type, DDOT’s focus is to also repair or replace the adjacent sidewalks, curbs, and gutters in conjunction to the street repair, if applicable. In addition, DDOT has established a ward based contract which allows timely and successful implementation and execution of work plans.  Annual work (construction) plans are based on the available funding and fulfill the Mayor's initiatives and objectives and benefits the residents as well.    There is a separate road reconstruction project for each ward.",
    "justification": "DDOT’s goal is to preserve our current roadway system and provide maintenance as needed.  This service helps to avoid the more costly reconstruction and upgrading repairs. DDOT’s local roads are an integral part of the Districts infrastructure system.  Residents, commuters, tourists, and those in the business community rely on DDOT for the city’s streets to be safe, reliable and functional, thus the maintenance of these roads is critical. This project aligns with SustainableDC Actions: Transportation 2.1 and 2.4.",
    "progress_assessment": "DDOT develops an annual construction plan based on the approved budget.  This construction plan serves not only as the plan for which a construction schedule is adhered to but the is made available to the public so that they can become aware of when DDOT will be in their community to begin construction.",

These assets are also essential for the well-being of businesses, commuters, and pedestrians.     DDOT's multi-year performance-based contract maintains the District's lighting assets.  The contractor is responsible for managing all lighting assets within public space, including alleys and streetlights, highways, underpasses, tunnels, bridges, navigation lights, overhead guide signs, and “Welcome to Washington, DC” signs.  A number of lighting systems and the electrical control systems for the Frederick Douglas Bridge are also included.      In this performance-based asset preservation contract, the desired outcome is specified rather than the means and methods: the contractor is instructed what to achieve, not how to achieve it.  The District requires that the contractor meet a set of performance standards for all assets and DDOT personnel conduct citywide monthly and annual inspections to measure the contractor’s performance.  DDOT personnel also monitor the contractor’s response for repair requests and schedules daily.  The contract includes both incentives and disincentives for failing or exceeding these performance measures.  The asset contractor has improved the lighting performance by reducing outages from a high of 20 percent two years ago (FY07) to less one percent this year (FY09).     This project also includes upgrades to lighting assets, including the conversion of traditional lighting to high efficiency LED technology. The project also funds staff who implement this program.",

Equipment – in the form of signature pads.  Approximately twenty of these devices have already been put in place, allowing the hospital to apply electronic signatures to electronic forms, furthering the development of a fully digital EMR.

Additional detail and specifications are located in Appendix B, Management Report Specs.

Based on past meetings with these regulatory bodies, requests for new forms or changes to existing forms will be mandated.

    "description": "The District of Columbia provides information technology services critical to public safety, public welfare, and government operations from its two primary data centers located within the District. This project will facilitate the relocation of the OCTO data centers to sites that are more secure, have robust infrastructure, and have sufficient capacity to meet current and future needs. The scope of the project is to find and prepare suitable data center sites, relocate the services to those sites, and support necessary capital improvements. One data center will remain in a leased facility. The other data center will be moved to a state-of–the-art leased facility outside of the District of Columbia. Doing so eliminates current issues with space and power capacity, as well as improves the District’s disaster recovery capability.",
    "justification": "This project is necessary and urgent because both data centers no longer have sufficient space and power available to meet current and future demands, their infrastructures are old and in need of costly major upgrades, and they are too close together for Disaster Recovery purposes. As the current data centers are only five (5) miles apart, a serious incident may affect both. Leasing a facility outside the District will mitigate this risk.",

CityDW works with the City Administrator, DCStat and with District agencies to supply data, business intelligence tools and dashboards.  CityDW gathers data and builds reporting environments for DCStat (http://capstat.oca.dc.gov/DC.aspx) and agencies like CFSA, DDOT, OUC (311 and 991 data).  CityDW also builds custom applications and dashboards to display the data like internal reporting and tracking tools like TrackDC (a public version will be released in FY10).   CityDW, being the centralized location for a large amount of city data, is also charged with making, the data available to the public.  One example is the District’s Data Catalog that provides over 400 datasets in easy to access formats (spreadsheets, Google Maps, Google Earth).  For years the District of Columbia has provided public access to city operational data through the Internet to help agencies operate as more responsive, better performing organizations. The Data Catalog can be used to view or download a variety of data like crimes, service requests, procurements, permits, constructions projects, purchase card transactions, purchase orders and more.",
    "justification": "Information is one of the most under-utilized assets in government. Without the proper data sharing in place, agencies often bear all costs associated with collecting, storing, and protecting data without realizing any noticeable benefits. CityDW gathers and makes this data available to the Office of the City Administrator, agencies, employees and citizens. CityDW was selected from over 700 applicants by the Ash Institute as the winner of the 2009 Innovations in American Government Award in Urban Policy.",
    "progress_assessment": "CityDW now publishes over 400 datasets via the Data Catalog (http://data.octo.dc.gov/), and built four applications that are available to the public that make it easy to access and view data including crime and service requests on a map.",

In addition, it will enable the use of self-service for all city employees and extend for the first time the use of the applications to include non-employees such as contractors and volunteers, eliminate paper forms, support 360-degree performance feedback and secure access for DC employees from outside DC’s network. This program implements a single enterprise wide software platform that will replace several DCHR IT legacy systems (HR Gateway, PMP, PES, ASPEN SumTotal, and paper/excel documents/reports). Operating costs are reduced by 1) eliminating DCHR’s IT support and maintenance costs for its stand-alone applications, 2) streamlining HR operations, and 3) reducing amount of printed paper.  In FY 2010 Workforce Analytics will provide managers with the capability to perform complex analysis of the District’s workforce to assist in decisions about staffing, hiring and workforce deployment.",

The 11th Street Bridges design build project represents a significant step forward in DDOT ’s Anacostia Waterfront Initiative infrastructure endeavor. The project will improve mobility by providing separate freeway and local traffic connections to area roadways. Providing these connections will allow for the creation of the  “Grand Urban Boulevard” envisioned for the South Capitol Street Corridor. The project provides multi-modal transportation options for cars, pedestrians, bicycles, and the future DC Streetcar; replaces existing structures that are both functionally deficient and structurally obsolete; provides an additional alternate evacuation route from our Nation’s Capital; and supports the overall environmental mission of the Anacostia Waterfront Initiative. The first phase of the innovative design build to budget project started construction in December 2009, and is scheduled to be completed in 2013. This project is the largest project ever completed by DDOT and is the first river bridge replacement in the District of Columbia in more than 40 years. Completing this project will improve travel for both local and regional traffic.",

Specifically, this project makes the essential upgrades needed to maintain adequate public facilities.  Among the capital improvements required in District-owned facilities are roof replacements, window replacements, and HVAC (heating and air-conditioning systems) replacements.  In addition, this project can be used for priority building improvement projects that may have not been planned for as part of the facilities condition assessment.  Even with excellent planning, there is often a need to address critical infrastructure needs in District buildings.",

    "description": "This project will completely modernize and refine the District’s tax systems to bring them in line with industry best practices and add new functionality in the areas of compliance, collections, case management,   individual, business and property tax collection; and processing and accounting. The tax system modernization will be achieved in stages to replace individual components starting with the case management module, real property system, and eventually the core tax management system.    This project represents a modernization of the Integrated Tax System (ITS). The current system will require a technology refresh, particularly on the reporting and middle-ware tools, to take advantage of web-based technologies that were not available when the system was installed. This will require replacement of the SAND and the Crystal server-based systems currently in use for report and query building as well as supporting platform software and related applications. This investment will allow the core underlying system to remain in place, while simplifying maintenance requirements and allowing for further consolidation of servers and reduced bandwidth requirements.",
    "justification": "The first phase is to replace the real property tax module, to address and reduce the risk of fraud and mismanagement by leveraging superior internal controls and industry best practices implemented in the replacement system.  In addition, the new case management system will provide intelligent case analytics; and review and analysis abilities that will result in increased tax compliance and collections, further resulting in increased revenues.  The implementation of the Phase 1 will result in the capture of new tax revenue that will be recognized as Paygo transfers from the general fund to the capital fund in the amount of $11.5 million in FY2014 - FY2016.  This capital budget will help to offset the project costs.",
    "progress_assessment": "The project is currently in the planning phase and high-level designs of all the different projects within the modernization initiative are being developed.  The District’s project manager for this effort has been hired.  Currently, requirements are being collected for the case management and real property tax system modules.",

The new Palisades Neighborhood Library will reflect the program and goals of the library and the needs of the District of Columbia residents that use it. The building will incorporate forward-thinking approaches to urban design, architecture, engineering and environmental technologies in the public realm. The new Palisades Neighborhood Library will be a destination that will attract and support hundreds of users per day, and promote a vibrant, mixed-use neighborhood and active street environment. The new library will have an iconic architectural presence befitting its location in the community, yet be reflective of the city's modern growth and new innovations in building design and technology. The library design will be unique in the nation's capital, and representative of 21st century architectural ideals. A building condition assessment was conducted in 2001 and an additional building assessment was completed in December 2009.

The goal of the Initiative is to redevelop the neighborhoods into healthy, vibrant, mixed-use, mixed-income communities for current and future residents.  Phase I of the New Communities Implementation Strategy is estimated to result in the creation of approximately 3,500 mixed-income housing units, including an estimated 900 affordable replacement units, across all 4 New Communities. Each plan includes three parts: (1) Physical Strategy to guide implementation of the area’s physical redevelopment; (2) Financial Strategy to fund the redevelopment activities; and (3) Human Capital to provide existing residents with support services.",
    "justification": "This project includes the comprehensive redevelopment of neighborhoods with high concentrations of low income housing and high rates of crimes.  The projects replace low density single use housing with stable neighborhood anchors such as schools, community centers, neighborhood servicing retail to create sustainable safe mixed income mixed use community.",

    "description": "A site for the new Engine 22 has been selected on the southeast corner of Georgia Avenue and Butternut Street NW. An architect has been selected to design a 30,000 square foot four bay facility that can provide the community with effective Fire and EMS Service and provide underground parking for our members, a new state-of-the-art fire station as well as a back up Fire Operations Center and a community room for public use.",
    "justification": "This project is necessary because the current Engine 22 was built in 1897 and has long outlived its life expectancy, making the project is extremly urgent. It will benefit the District taxpayers by lowering response times to the northern portion of Engine 22's response area and by allowing the members of Engine 22 to work and live in a modern, safe and efficient fire station. This project supports the Mayor's priorities by moving Engine 22, Truck 11 and Ambulance 22 further north and reducing response times in the northern portion of their response area. This project aligns with SustainableDC Action: Built Environment 3.5.",

The project construction is on hold pending the transfer from the U.S Army of the Walter Reed campus at Georgia Avenue and Aspen Street NW. Therefore, budget is approved for construction in FY 2014 and FY 2015.",

Much of the building’s infrastructure is original and has exceeded its intended life.  The building’s electrical, plumbing, lighting, HVAC system, and living quarters are past useful service and will be replaced. The scope for this building includes repairing and restoring deteriorating exterior shell, replacing or refurbishing all windows and doors, installing a negative pressure gear room, renovating the basement, stabilizing the building's rear foundation, renovating the garage, and installing radiant strip heating. Code compliant fire alarm and fire sprinkler systems, an emergency generator, the roof and roof drainage systems will be replaced.  Interior improvements will include replacing and widening apparatus doors and installing a residential washer and dryer.  The kitchen, sleeping quarters, living quarters, bathrooms, showers and locker rooms will be replaced.  In the building exterior area the front apron and side alleys will be repaved and the new trench drains will be installed. Finally, an ADA compliant public restroom will be installed.

The interior of this historic building will be redesigned and all of the building’s electrical, lighting systems and plumbing will be replaced to the Silver level of the LEED standard for renovations.  The storm water management system will be replaced.  Working with the Historic Preservation Office, FEMS will widen the apparatus bay door to accomodate the larger apparatus FEMS will be required to purchase to meet the 2010 EPA Clean Emissions Standard.

    "justification": "Currently sentencing related data used by the Commission is transferred from DCSC and filtered through JUSTIS.   The interface with JUSTIS is designed to accept only specific data variables from the court, which are then transferred into the agency’s database and web application.  This data transfer system was designed in 2005, and provides for a daily transfer of individual case disposition and sentencing related data.  The Commission annually receives offender and offense related data from approximately 4,300 felony counts.  Data is initially transferred when a case disposition occurs and then updated when a sentence is imposed.  Thus, there are approximately 10,000 data transmissions from the court to the Commission annually.  This data has enabled the Commission to determine judicial compliance, analyze sentencing trends and evaluate the effectiveness of the sentencing guidelines.  It is from this data that the agency creates its Annual Reports, Issues Papers and responses to various data requests from criminal justice professionals.  Data analysis is the core function of the agency and it is the source of information from which modifications to the guidelines are developed and implemented as required in D.C. Code §3-101(b)(2)-(6).    DCSC will be implementing a new Integrated Justice Information System (IJIS) Outbound 12.1.  This will replace the RAM Server—the technology by which data from the court is now transferred—with the new IJIS Broker.  Currently, agencies pull data directly from the Agency Database; however, after the implementation of IJIS Outbound 12.1, agencies will pull data directly from JUSTIS and the agency database will cease to function as it is currently constructed.  In addition, JUSTIS will use an XML to facilitate a full data transfer from the court without any filtering.  The RAM Server and Agency Database are scheduled to be shut down six months after the IJIS Outbound 12.1 is fully implemented, which should tentatively occur in late 2012 or early 2013.  At that time, if agencies have not made the necessary changes to their respective data systems, they will no longer receive data from the court.    The Commission will be required to change its interface with JUSTIS to accept unfiltered data elements and transfer the data to a Staging Database from which the necessary and required data elements can be transferred to the agency’s database and web application.  Currently, the agency does not utilize a staging database and will need to construct one.  In addition, the amount of data available through IJIS Outbound 12.1 will increase significantly and the current agency web application was not constructed to process unfiltered data.  Further, changes will need to be made to the agency’s web application to utilize the additional data being provided.      If funding is not available to make the required changes to maintain compatibility with IJIS Outbound 12.1 and the Commission can no longer receive sentencing data from the court, the agency will be unable to meet any of its statutory duties.",

    "description": "DCPS has set a goal to modernize the IT infrastructure at the Schools so that all students and staff have access to a high-speed, reliable, and secure network. Schools need to have 100% wireless coverage in all teaching and administrative areas, and each classroom should have active network drops to support any device plugged into them (printers, PC's, interactive whiteboards, etc.).  Seventy schools have or will be modernized by the 2014 - 2015 school year. Thirty - three more schools desperately need new routers, new switches, power upgrades, cabling work and new wireless Access Points (AP's) installed to be modernized by the 2-15 - 2016 school year. DC-Net analyzed all of the network equipment components and identified those components at the end of their useful life cycle, thus needing replacement. This aging equipment fails often, is costly to maintain, and gets in the way of establishing the wireless network needed by the Schools.",

The existing building is undersized to meet the school’s current needs and it is envisioned that new space will need to be added as an “inѕfill” addition in order to fully meet programmatic requirements, creating a total building square footage of approximately 165,000. The renovated facility will serve approximately 600 students and will serve as a regional magnet school for the performing arts.

The HIX and DC CARES will enable District customers to use online and call center services to apply for and enroll in Medicaid, TANF, Food Stamps, and other federal and local health and human services programs. DHS and DHCF will be able to manage customers’ multiple programs with the consolidated case management functionality that will also be implemented as part of this project.",
    "justification": "Pursuant to the Affordable Care act of 2010 (ACA), the District is required to have a robust web-based eligibility system by October 1, 2013. Consequently, this project  will integrate the Health Insurance Exchange with the existing case management system, allowing District customers to use online and call center services to apply for and enroll in Medicaid, TANF, Food Stamps, and other federal and local health and human services programs. District citizens and families that find themselves in need of support or help are often the least able to help themselves negotiate the maze of agencies to find and enroll in the appropriate programs. They are often required to travel between several offices and provide a variety of documents to prove their eligibility for services. An integrated approach would allow a citizen to find out about the available District and federal resources available to them through a wide variety of programs and providers. Multiple agencies throughout the District serve the same families, children and adults, often at the same time through separately maintained systems and infrastructures.  This approach will simplify the process.",

The idea for a quick, efficient, low-cost, public-transit system originated in the National Capital Planning Commission's 1997 \"Extending the Legacy: Planning America's Capital for the 21st Century\" vision for the District.  This dynamic transit system promotes ease of movement in our world-class capital city and complements Metro's transit services throughout the region.    Now more than a decade after beginning operation, the DC Circulator is expanding to the National Mall.  DDOT is also working to deliver the Integrated Premium Transit program that will combine Circulator service, and bring successful elements of this program to the District’s Streetcar system.    The project is the identification of a bus garage site for Circulator buses.  It includes preliminary engineering, design, and ultimately construction of a new facility or rehabilitation of an existing facility for that purpose.",

It is anticipated that by 2030 a comprehensive streetcar network will operate in conjunction with the Circulator, Metro Extra rapid bus, and bus rapid transit to complement the current Metro bus and rail system. Current funding levels are based on a first phase 22 mile system and will support the completion of the H Street/Benning Road Line between the intersection of North Capitol Street and H Street, N.E. on the west and the Anacostia River on the east.  § 9-1173 of the DC Code limits expansion or construction of aerial wire-powered streetcar transit until the Mayor submits an aerial wire plan, hearings are held, and the Council approves the plan by resolution.  Included in this project is the full replacement of the H Street Bridge, which shall have funding priority.  Depending on the need for aerial wires and aerial wire plan approval, funding in this project may be also used to extend the H Street/Benning Road Line.  Funding for other lines is budgeted in related projects.",

Surface transit options are needed to complement the Metro system and connect all District neighborhoods with efficient, reliable and affordable means of public transportation.

Regardless of the construction type, DDOT’s focus is to also repair or replace the adjacent sidewalks, curbs, and gutters in conjunction to the street repair, if applicable. In addition, DDOT has established a ward based contract which allows timely and successful implementation and execution of work plans. Annual work (construction) plans are based on the available funding and fulfill the Mayor's initiatives and objectives and benefits the residents as well.    There is a separate road reconstruction project for each ward.",

    "description": "The District’s lighting assets are critical to the safety of District’s residents and visitors.  These assets are also essential for the well-being of businesses, commuters, and pedestrians.     DDOT's multi-year performance-based contract maintains the District's lighting assets.  The contractor is responsible for managing all lighting assets within public space, including alleys and streetlights, highways, underpasses, tunnels, bridges, navigation lights, overhead guide signs, and “Welcome to Washington, DC” signs.  A number of lighting systems and the electrical control systems for the Frederick Douglas Bridge are also included.      In this performance-based asset preservation contract, the desired outcome is specified rather than the means and methods: the contractor is instructed what to achieve, not how to achieve it.  The District requires that the contractor meet a set of performance standards for all assets and DDOT personnel conduct citywide monthly and annual inspections to measure the contractor’s performance.  DDOT personnel also monitor the contractor’s response for repair requests and schedules daily.  The contract includes both incentives and disincentives for failing or exceeding these performance measures.

Since 2010, this project produced needed network equipment to improve existing network capacity and capabilities. It deployed the network infrastructure necessary to provide government and public wireless internet access at government locations, including parks and recreation facilities, schools.    Provided network connectivity through major capital modernization programs at several new buildings, such as, the District building at 2001 Street and the Consolidated Forensic Lab (CFL).     As part of the schools network modernization program for DCPS, relocated administrative office personnel from 11 DCPS sites to alternative locations and reinstated full continuity of service in virtually transparent deployments within two business days. Completed the network upgrade for a total of 20 schools in the summer of 2012.  This massive undertaking allowed both structural and IT upgrades to be completed during the summer months and ensured fully enhanced educational facilities when the teachers and children were moved back for the fall semester.",

This project will facilitate the relocation of the OCTO data centers to sites that are more secure, have robust infrastructure, and have sufficient capacity to meet current and future needs. The scope of the project is to find and prepare suitable data center sites, relocate the services to those sites, and support necessary capital improvements. One data center will be moved to a District-owned, recently constructed, highly secure site at the Unified Communications Center (UCC). The other data center will be moved to a state-of–the-art leased facility outside of the District of Columbia. Doing so will eliminate current issues with space and power capacity, as well as improve the District’s disaster recovery capability.",

As the current data centers are only five (5) miles apart, a serious incident may affect both. Leasing a facility outside the District will mitigate this risk.",

Migration of data center services to the new leased facility will commence throughout FY 2010.  DRES working in conjunction with OCTO has selected an A&E firm for the Design/Build of the data center space within the UCC.    Since 2012 migrated and consolidated several District agencies (Department of Employment   Services, Department of Housing and Community Development, Child and Family Services   Agency, and Department of General Services) to the OCTO data centers, resulting in lower operational and maintenance costs, as these agencies no longer had to support and maintain their own disparate/silo datacenter.  The data center consolidation effort is an ongoing effort which has significantly lowered the District's server footprint. In FY12 alone this effort has resulted in the decommissioning of three OCTO-operated data centers and migration of over 300 servers to OCTO's 'greener' data centers, resulting in a net savings for the District.",

As a result, web content pertaining to agencies such as MPDC, HSEMA and other public safety agencies is not readily available when residents use their tablets or mobile devices. The same is true with regard to transparency. Content the enables residents to obtain critical information on DC.Gov websites, FOIA information for example, is not so readily available other than when using a desktop computer.",

Sub-projects for FY2011 included:    Content Management System - In FY2010, the existing website management software, used to publish DC.Gov - the District’s official, government web portal, was badly out of date, not an industry standard, not scalable, and did not lend itself to modern web publishing and management that residents would expect. OCTO began converting the DC.Gov home page, agency websites and associated web portals to a new web platform that was more customer-centric and takes advantage of a number of Web 2.0 features such as social networking.  The conversion project would ultimately consolidate approximately 125 District websites into approximately 90 up-to-date websites with a new look and feel.     By the end of the first quarter of FY2011, 40 DC.Gov websites had been converted to the new web system, leaving approximately 50 agency sites to be migrated.   In the spring, OCTO made the decision to adopt a newer, more cost effective, open source web platform for all DC.Gov websites that will allow agency to post and share content quickly with greater ease.  By the end of FY11, OCTO had installed and configured the new, open source system, developed new content templates with an improved design, and launched OSSE’s new website.   In FY11 OCTO spent $376,872 of N3699C funds for a dedicated ITSA project team to set up the new Drupal platform from which OCTO would convert the remaining 50 agencies sites.   In FY12, OCTO spent $1,216,140 on the conversion 46 of the remaining 50 agencies sites, as well as launching a new mobile platform for DC.Gov.  In FY13, OCTO will migrate the 4 legacy sites plus 40 websites that were originally moved to the web system that was ultimately replaced by the open source system.",

    "description": "District agencies’ technology needs increasingly require additional servers to host applications within the two OCTO Data Centers.  This project allows OCTO to maintain a robust virtual server pool, which has the dual benefit of providing modern equipment to improve application performance, as well as decreasing the overall operating cost of the data centers due to a decrease in the need for physical servers. Virtual server pools can be defined as taking one physical server and making it appear as many servers on the network.",
    "justification": "This project allows for the continuous improvement of OCTO’s virtual server pool. This technology eliminates the need for costly 1-to-1 mapping of production and Disaster Recovery servers.   This project ensures the availability of critical services that OCTO provides to the entire District. The demand on the virtual server platform increases every year and a refresh of equipment allows OCTO to meet new demand and handle the current load. The servers in this virtual pool host critical applications for agencies.",
    "progress_assessment": "This project is progressing as planned. In FY2012 deployment for additional hardware and software will continue to further consolidate the dispersed and redundant server technologies throughout the District.",

This structure will spark the transformation of the South Capitol Street corridor and create a world class gateway between the east and west sides of the Anacostia River. Additional park lands will be created in the area adjacent to the new bridge to promote liveable communities, expand recreational options, and reconnect the city to the Anacostia riverfront. Economic development opportunities will be created and improved connectivity for residents will be provided to federal installations and job centers, including enhanced access to the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Navy Yard, Bolling Air Force Base, the Anacostia Annex, and Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland.",

The 11th Street Bridges design build project represents a significant step forward in DDOT ’s Anacostia Waterfront Initiative infrastructure endeavor. The project will improve mobility by providing separate freeway and local traffic connections to area roadways. Providing these connections will allow for the creation of the  “Grand Urban Boulevard” envisioned for the South Capitol Street Corridor. The project provides multi-modal transportation options for cars, pedestrians, bicycles, and the future DC Streetcar; replaces existing structures that are both functionally deficient and structurally obsolete; provides an additional alternate evacuation route from our Nation’s Capital; and supports the overall environmental mission of the Anacostia Waterfront Initiative. The first phase of the innovative design build to budget project started construction in December 2009, and is scheduled to be completed in 2013. This project is the largest project ever completed by DDOT and is the first river bridge replacement in the District of Columbia in more than 40 years. Completing this project will improve travel for both local and regional traffic.",
