OF CONSUMER AND REGULATORY AFFAIRS (CR0)","location":"DISTRICT-WIDE","status":"Ongoing Subprojects","description":"The project funds the abatement of critical life and safety issues for vacant, District-owned residential and multi-dwelling units throughout the District of Columbia. In future years, paygo funding will be used for remediating violations of the housing code when property has failed to be maintained adequately. Project management will work more closely in the future with the property acquisition and disposition program of the Department of Housing and Community Development.","justification":"When owners fail to repay remediation costs, DCRA pursues recovery of outlays through the imposition of special assessments and liens against properties. Recoveries are directed to an associated special purpose revenue fund used to cover on-going program costs.","progress_assessment":"This project is progressing as planned.","related_projects":"Department of Housing and Community Development project 04002C-PROPERTY ACQUISITION & DISPOSITION","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{},"design_complete":{},"construction_start":{},"construction_complete":{},"closeout":{}},"useful_life":10,"facility":"VARIOUS","ward":"","est_cost":50808000,"lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2010,"last_year":2013,"cip_history":{"FY 2010":{"FY 2010":5000,"FY 2011":5000,"FY 2012":5000,"FY 2013":5000,"FY 2014":2500,"FY 2015":0},"FY 2011":{"FY 2011":5000,"FY 2012":2500,"FY 2013":1000,"FY 2014":1250,"FY 2015":0,"FY 2016":0},"FY 2012":{"FY 2012":0,"FY 2013":0,"FY 2014":0,"FY 2015":1000,"FY 2016":0,"FY 2017":4000},"FY 2013":{"FY 2013":0,"FY 2014":0,"FY 2015":1000,"FY 2016":0,"FY 2017":0,"FY 2018":0}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(04) Construction":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":38470,"spent":36787,"proposed":5000},"FY 2011":{"allotted":44984,"spent":38830,"proposed":5000},"FY 2012":{"allotted":49808,"spent":43569,"proposed":0},"FY 2013":{"allotted":49466,"spent":45925,"proposed":0}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":5000},"FY 2011":{"allotted":5000,"spent":1354,"proposed":5000},"FY 2012":{"allotted":10000,"spent":5201,"proposed":0},"FY 2013":{"allotted":9658,"spent":7268,"proposed":0}},"Pay Go (0301)":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":3485,"spent":2559,"proposed":0},"FY 2011":{"allotted":3485,"spent":3220,"proposed":0},"FY 2012":{"allotted":3309,"spent":3293,"proposed":0},"FY 2013":{"allotted":3309,"spent":3293,"proposed":0}},"Capital (9000)":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":34984,"spent":34227,"proposed":0},"FY 2011":{"allotted":36499,"spent":34255,"proposed":0},"FY 2012":{"allotted":36499,"spent":35075,"proposed":0},"FY 2013":{"allotted":36499,"spent":35364,"proposed":0}}},"total_funding":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":38470,"spent":36787,"proposed":5000},"FY 2011":{"allotted":44984,"spent":38830,"proposed":5000},"FY 2012":{"allotted":49808,"spent":43569,"proposed":0},"FY 2013":{"allotted":49466,"spent":45925,"proposed":0}}}}
