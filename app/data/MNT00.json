Primary (projects on streets functionally classified as National Highway System routes or Major arterials)  d. Secondary (projects on streets functionally classified as minor arterials or collectors – technically local street projects are not “regionally significant” and therefore need not be in the TIP at all, nor are they eligible for highway trust fund investment anyway so these would be scrubbed out)  e.
