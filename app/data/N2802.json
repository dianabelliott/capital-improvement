The SLED will be the main repository of the District of Columbia’s current and historical public education  student, teacher, and school data. The data will be used for education planning, analysis, research, and reporting. The SLED will be populated with information extracted from disparate enterprise educational systems into a single comprehensive relational database. It will standardize student academic information currently stored in various local education agencies (LEAs) and it will track student information statewide over multiple years and across education institutions. Once built, the SLED will enable the sharing of critical information that tracks student learning spanning early care and education, K-12 programs, post-secondary, and adult education. It will ultimately link to other youth and adult serving institutions to provide a comprehensive picture of the District of Columbia’s learners.","justification":"To continue qualifying and competing for federal funds, OSSE must demonstrate its capacity to link or its plans to link student information across pre-school, K-12 and postsecondary education, as well as workforce data.  As a 2007 recipient of $5,700,000 in federal grant funds to build a state longitudinal data system, OSSE must also fulfill the terms of the grant agreement to keep the funds and avoid default.","progress_assessment":"In March 2010, OSSE decided to abandon the “old” SLED and began creating a “new” SLED using Microsoft’s SQL Server as its database with a SharePoint front-end. In August 2010, an RFP was published and as of September 29th, five proposals had been received.","related_projects":"NA","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{},"design_complete":{"projected":"12/31/2009","actual":"12/31/2009"},"construction_start":{"projected":"10/31/2007"},"construction_complete":{"projected":"07/31/2014"},"closeout":{"projected":"08/30/2014"}},"useful_life":10,"facility":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY","est_cost":25423000,"lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2010,"last_year":2013,"cip_history":{"FY 2010":{"FY 2010":5000,"FY 2011":0,"FY 2012":0,"FY 2013":0,"FY 2014":0,"FY 2015":0},"FY 2011":{"FY 2011":0,"FY 2012":4000,"FY 2013":3600,"FY 2014":0,"FY 2015":0,"FY 2016":0},"FY 2012":{"FY 2012":4000,"FY 2013":3600,"FY 2014":0,"FY 2015":0,"FY 2016":0,"FY 2017":0},"FY 2013":{"FY 2013":3600,"FY 2014":0,"FY 2015":0,"FY 2016":0,"FY 2017":0,"FY 2018":0}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(05) Equipment":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":13583,"spent":6591,"proposed":5000},"FY 2011":{"allotted":17823,"spent":9641,"proposed":0},"FY 2012":{"allotted":17823,"spent":12880,"proposed":4000},"FY 2013":{"allotted":21823,"spent":15188,"proposed":3600}}},"funding_by_source":{"Equipment Lease (0302)":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":13583,"spent":6591,"proposed":5000},"FY 2011":{"allotted":17063,"spent":8881,"proposed":0},"FY 2012":{"allotted":17063,"spent":12356,"proposed":4000},"FY 2013":{"allotted":21063,"spent":14495,"proposed":3600}},"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY 2011":{"allotted":760,"spent":760,"proposed":0},"FY 2012":{"allotted":760,"spent":524,"proposed":0},"FY 2013":{"allotted":760,"spent":693,"proposed":0}}},"total_funding":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":13583,"spent":6591,"proposed":5000},"FY 2011":{"allotted":17823,"spent":9641,"proposed":0},"FY 2012":{"allotted":17823,"spent":12880,"proposed":4000},"FY 2013":{"allotted":21823,"spent":15188,"proposed":3600}}}}
