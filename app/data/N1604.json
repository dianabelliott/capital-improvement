{"active":true,"project_no":"N1604","title":"ELC-N1604-DC GIS MASTER LEASE","agency":"OFFICE OF CHIEF TECHNOLOGY OFFICER (TO0)","implementing_agency":"EQUIPMENT LEASE - CAPITAL (ELC)","location":"DISTRICT-WIDE","status":"Ongoing Subprojects","description":"The District of Columbia Geographic Information System (DC GIS) provides public safety, economic development, and other public-facing District agencies – as well as the general public – with a “one-stop shop” for geospatial data and enterprise applications.   GIS technology empowers policymakers and implementers with data and application tools that support better decision-making and performance.  This capital fund is used for large, recurring data acquisition projects (including biannual photogrammetric mapping), shared applications, and computer hardware.  OCTO coordinates and facilitates cross-agency investments through the DC GIS Steering Committee and supports these cross-agency activities by providing technical expertise and paying for a portion of the cross-agency projects.","justification":"Detailed maps, information, and the applications that employ them are an inherent part of state and local government.  The DC GIS is utilized across the District government – and its data and applications are the basis of many government operations and decisions. DC GIS works with numerous agencies to make District agencies be better stewards of our environment, be more prepared for emergencies, improve public safety, be more efficient in government operations, track assets and projects, be more competitive and careful in our economic development, and be more thorough and fair in our revenue collection.","progress_assessment":"DC has developed and continues to invest in a geospatial program that is considered a national model for local governments.      Due to several challenges, the only planned effort of the 2012 Planimetric and Ortho Project which creates DC’s basemap was delayed until FY2013.","related_projects":"Project ZA143C also funds the DC GIS.   The difference between N1604C and ZA143C is the type of funding and the permitted spending, not the intent or governance of the DC GIS.","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{"actual":"10/01/2002"},"design_complete":{"projected":"09/30/2010","actual":"09/30/2010"},"construction_start":{"actual":"06/01/2002"},"construction_complete":{"projected":"06/01/2020"},"closeout":{"projected":"12/01/2020"}},"useful_life":5,"facility":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY","ward":"","est_cost":5015000,"lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2010,"last_year":2015,"cip_history":{"FY 2010":{"FY 2010":1100,"FY 2011":460,"FY 2012":1000,"FY 2013":500,"FY 2014":1055,"FY 2015":500},"FY 2011":{"FY 2011":337,"FY 2012":500,"FY 2013":500,"FY 2014":528,"FY 2015":0,"FY 2016":800},"FY 2012":{"FY 2012":500,"FY 2013":500,"FY 2014":528,"FY 2015":550,"FY 2016":800,"FY 2017":1550},"FY 2013":{"FY 2013":0,"FY 2014":528,"FY 2015":550,"FY 2016":800,"FY 2017":1550,"FY 2018":0},"FY 2014":{"FY 2014":528,"FY 2015":550,"FY 2016":0,"FY 2017":0,"FY 2018":0,"FY 2019":0},"FY 2015":{"FY 2015":550,"FY 2016":0,"FY 2017":0,"FY 2018":0,"FY 2019":0,"FY 2020":0}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(06) IT Requirements Development/Systems Design":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":2000,"spent":1482,"proposed":1100},"FY 2011":{"allotted":3100,"spent":2183,"proposed":337},"FY 2012":{"allotted":3437,"spent":3131,"proposed":500},"FY 2013":{"allotted":3937,"spent":3319,"proposed":0},"FY 2014":{"allotted":3937,"spent":3319,"proposed":528},"FY 2015":{"allotted":4465,"spent":3378,"proposed":550}},"(07) IT Development & Testing":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":1035,"spent":866,"proposed":1100},"FY 2011":{"allotted":2135,"spent":1259,"proposed":337},"FY 2013":{"allotted":2972,"spent":2386,"proposed":0},"FY 2014":{"allotted":2972,"spent":2386,"proposed":528},"FY 2015":{"allotted":3500,"spent":2445,"proposed":550}},"(07) IT Development Testing":{"FY 2012":{"allotted":2472,"spent":2198,"proposed":500}}},"funding_by_source":{"Equipment Lease (0302)":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":2000,"spent":1482,"proposed":1100},"FY 2011":{"allotted":3100,"spent":2184,"proposed":337},"FY 2012":{"allotted":3437,"spent":3131,"proposed":500},"FY 2013":{"allotted":3937,"spent":3319,"proposed":0},"FY 2014":{"allotted":3937,"spent":3319,"proposed":528},"FY 2015":{"allotted":4465,"spent":3378,"proposed":550}}},"total_funding":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":2000,"spent":1482,"proposed":1100},"FY 2011":{"allotted":3100,"spent":2183,"proposed":337},"FY 2012":{"allotted":3437,"spent":3131,"proposed":500},"FY 2013":{"allotted":3937,"spent":3319,"proposed":0},"FY 2014":{"allotted":3937,"spent":3319,"proposed":528},"FY 2015":{"allotted":4465,"spent":3378,"proposed":550}}}}
