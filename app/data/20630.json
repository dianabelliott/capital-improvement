Existing vehicles need to be replaced at the rate that meets NFPA standards and as they wear out and surpass their economic retention levels.","justification":"Replacing older firefighting apparatus and ambulances at a rate that keeps the Departmentâ€™s fleet at an age and condition that meets NFPA standards is essential to maintaining an effective firefighting force.  This project is necessary to ensure that the fleet is reliable and does not deteriorate into a condition that leaves it unreliable and requiring extensive maintenance to keep it running. This project aligns with SustainableDC Action: Transportation 4.2.","progress_assessment":"This is an on-going fleet replacement project. The balance of current allotment is sufficient for FY 2013 purchases.","related_projects":"20600C (GO-BOND FUND IN FY14).","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{},"design_complete":{},"construction_start":{},"construction_complete":{},"closeout":{}},"useful_life":7,"facility":"EQUIPMENT","image":"fy15-119_1.jpg","ward":"","est_cost":129038000,"lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2010,"last_year":2020,"cip_history":{"FY 2010":{"FY 2010":8096,"FY 2011":8096,"FY 2012":8096,"FY 2013":8096,"FY 2014":8096,"FY 2015":8096},"FY 2011":{"FY 2011":8096,"FY 2012":8096,"FY 2013":8096,"FY 2014":4048,"FY 2015":4048,"FY 2016":8096},"FY 2012":{"FY 2012":8096,"FY 2013":8096,"FY 2014":4048,"FY 2015":4048,"FY 2016":8096,"FY 2017":0},"FY 2013":{"FY 2013":0,"FY 2014":4048,"FY 2015":4048,"FY 2016":8096,"FY 2017":0,"FY 2018":0},"FY 2014":{"FY 2014":4000,"FY 2015":4000,"FY 2016":4000,"FY 2017":0,"FY 2018":0,"FY 2019":0},"FY 2015":{"FY 2015":9000,"FY 2016":9000,"FY 2017":0,"FY 2018":0,"FY 2019":15000,"FY 2020":15000}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(05) Equipment":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":52748,"spent":50094,"proposed":8096},"FY 2011":{"allotted":60844,"spent":55308,"proposed":8096},"FY 2012":{"allotted":68940,"spent":60403,"proposed":8096},"FY 2013":{"allotted":77036,"spent":67064,"proposed":0},"FY 2014":{"allotted":77036,"spent":72838,"proposed":4000},"FY 2015":{"allotted":81038,"spent":78146,"proposed":9000},"FY 2016":{"allotted":90038,"spent":78146,"proposed":9000},"FY 2017":{"allotted":99038,"spent":78146,"proposed":0},"FY 2018":{"allotted":99038,"spent":78146,"proposed":0},"FY 2019":{"allotted":99038,"spent":78146,"proposed":15000},"FY 2020":{"allotted":114038,"spent":78146,"proposed":15000}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":29395,"spent":29303,"proposed":0},"FY 2011":{"allotted":29395,"spent":29303,"proposed":0},"FY 2012":{"allotted":26391,"spent":26332,"proposed":0},"FY 2013":{"allotted":26391,"spent":26332,"proposed":0},"FY 2014":{"allotted":26391,"spent":26332,"proposed":0},"FY 2015":{"allotted":26391,"spent":26332,"proposed":0},"FY 2016":{"allotted":26391,"spent":26332,"proposed":0},"FY 2017":{"allotted":26391,"spent":26332,"proposed":0},"FY 2018":{"allotted":26391,"spent":26332,"proposed":0},"FY 2019":{"allotted":26391,"spent":26332,"proposed":0},"FY 2020":{"allotted":26391,"spent":26332,"proposed":0}},"Equipment Lease (0302)":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":23353,"spent":20792,"proposed":8096},"FY 2011":{"allotted":31449,"spent":25821,"proposed":8096},"FY 2012":{"allotted":42549,"spent":34071,"proposed":8096},"FY 2013":{"allotted":50645,"spent":40732,"proposed":0},"FY 2014":{"allotted":50645,"spent":46388,"proposed":4000},"FY 2015":{"allotted":54647,"spent":51697,"proposed":9000},"FY 2016":{"allotted":63647,"spent":51697,"proposed":9000},"FY 2017":{"allotted":72647,"spent":51697,"proposed":0},"FY 2018":{"allotted":72647,"spent":51697,"proposed":0},"FY 2019":{"allotted":72647,"spent":51697,"proposed":15000},"FY 2020":{"allotted":87647,"spent":51697,"proposed":15000}}},"total_funding":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":52748,"spent":50094,"proposed":8096},"FY 2011":{"allotted":60844,"spent":55308,"proposed":8096},"FY 2012":{"allotted":68940,"spent":60403,"proposed":8096},"FY 2013":{"allotted":77036,"spent":67064,"proposed":0},"FY 2014":{"allotted":77036,"spent":72838,"proposed":4000},"FY 2015":{"allotted":81038,"spent":78146,"proposed":9000},"FY 2016":{"allotted":90038,"spent":78146,"proposed":9000},"FY 2017":{"allotted":99038,"spent":78146,"proposed":0},"FY 2018":{"allotted":99038,"spent":78146,"proposed":0},"FY 2019":{"allotted":99038,"spent":78146,"proposed":15000},"FY 2020":{"allotted":114038,"spent":78146,"proposed":15000}}}}
