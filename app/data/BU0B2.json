VEHICLE REPLACEMENT","agency":"SPECIAL EDUCATION TRANSPORTATION (GO0)","implementing_agency":"EQUIPMENT LEASE - CAPITAL (ELC)","ward":"","location":"DISTRICT-WIDE","facility":"BUSES","status":"Ongoing Subprojects","description":"The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE)’s Division of Transportation (DOT) current fleet of buses ranges in age from 3-15 years old. DOT seeks to sustain a replacement schedule of 8-year useful life for its fleet. Under this plan, DOT would replace 100 vehicles per year in 5 tranches spaced evenly throughout the year.  This plan would allow DOT to replace each of their 800 vehicles every 8 years.","justification":"The useful life of a school bus is typically 8 years. Of OSSE DOT’s current fleet of approximately 800 buses, 308 are over 8 years, and some are as old as 15 years.  186 have over 100,000 miles of use.  These older buses also affect over-time payments to drivers and attendants and on-time statistics due to increased breakdowns on the road. The current cost to maintain these older vehicles is more than $7.2M annually.","progress_assessment":"Ongoing project.","related_projects":"BU0B0C-Vehicle Replacement","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{"projected":"01/01/2013"},"design_complete":{},"construction_start":{},"construction_complete":{"projected":"09/30/2016"},"closeout":{}},"est_cost":10347000,"useful_life":8,"lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2012,"last_year":2016,"cip_history":{"FY 2012":{"FY 2012":5719,"FY 2013":0,"FY 2014":0,"FY 2015":0,"FY 2016":0,"FY 2017":0},"FY 2013":{"FY 2013":1017,"FY 2014":0,"FY 2015":3200,"FY 2016":400,"FY 2017":0,"FY 2018":0},"FY 2014":{"FY 2014":0,"FY 2015":3200,"FY 2016":400,"FY 2017":0,"FY 2018":0,"FY 2019":0},"FY 2015":{"FY 2015":3200,"FY 2016":400,"FY 2017":0,"FY 2018":0,"FY 2019":0,"FY 2020":0}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(05) Equipment":{"FY 2012":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":5719},"FY 2013":{"allotted":5745,"spent":0,"proposed":1017},"FY 2014":{"allotted":6762,"spent":6748,"proposed":0},"FY 2015":{"allotted":6748,"spent":6748,"proposed":3200},"FY 2016":{"allotted":9948,"spent":6748,"new":400}}},"funding_by_source":{"Equipment Lease (0302)":{"FY 2012":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":5719},"FY 2013":{"allotted":5745,"spent":0,"proposed":1017},"FY 2014":{"allotted":6762,"spent":6748,"proposed":0},"FY 2015":{"allotted":6748,"spent":6748,"proposed":3200},"FY 2016":{"allotted":9948,"spent":6748,"new":400}}},"total_funding":{"FY 2012":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":5719},"FY 2013":{"allotted":5745,"spent":0,"proposed":1017},"FY 2014":{"allotted":6762,"spent":6748,"proposed":0},"FY 2015":{"allotted":6748,"spent":6748,"proposed":3200},"FY 2016":{"allotted":9948,"spent":6748,"new":400}}}}
