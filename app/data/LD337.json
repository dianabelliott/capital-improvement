This station has not had a major renovation since its construction in 1953 so it does not comply with current basic standards such as ADA access, female firefighter locker room accommodations, or an energy efficient HVAC system. It is currently housing more vehicles than it was designed to hold and needs additional garage space that is necessary to safely enter and leave the facility. This renovation will greatly improve the working conditions for all of the personnel assigned to this station and bring the station up to current codes and standards. A temporary fire station will provide uninterrupted protection to the community during this project.","justification":"Engine 30 station has not had a major renovation since its construction in 1953, so it does not comply with current basic standards such as ADA access, female firefighter locker room accommodations, or an energy efficient HVAC system.
