The purchase of snow equipment will help ensure that DDOT can meet the Mayorâ€™s standards for snow removal.  Parking meters, especially multi-space meters, help ensure that revenue owed to the District is collected.  Funds are also used to replace older fleet vehicles with new ones that are more fuel efficient and require less maintenance.","justification":"This project is necessary to provide for vehicles that remove snow from streets, to replace broken parking meters, and to provide replacement vehicles.  The DDOT fleet replacement plan helps ensure that vehicles are operational and to reduce maintenance costs (including fuel) as much as possible.","progress_assessment":"The project is progressing as planned.  Snow equipment and vehicles, parking meters, and other equipment are purchases according to replacement plans.","related_projects":"6EQ01C-EQUIPMENT REPLACEMENT, CE302C-EQUIPMENT MAINTENANCE","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{},"design_complete":{},"construction_start":{},"construction_complete":{},"closeout":{}},"useful_life":5,"ward":"","est_cost":11755000,"facility":"EQUIPMENT","lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2010,"last_year":2016,"cip_history":{"FY 2010":{"FY 2010":1000,"FY 2011":1000,"FY 2012":1500,"FY 2013":1500,"FY 2014":1500,"FY 2015":0},"FY 2011":{"FY 2011":1000,"FY 2012":500,"FY 2013":1000,"FY 2014":1000,"FY 2015":833,"FY 2016":1667},"FY 2012":{"FY 2012":500,"FY 2013":1000,"FY 2014":1000,"FY 2015":833,"FY 2016":3000,"FY 2017":0},"FY 2013":{"FY 2013":750,"FY 2014":1000,"FY 2015":833,"FY 2016":3000,"FY 2017":0,"FY 2018":1200},"FY 2014":{"FY 2014":1000,"FY 2015":833,"FY 2016":1500,"FY 2017":0,"FY 2018":200,"FY 2019":0},"FY 2015":{"FY 2015":500,"FY 2016":500,"FY 2017":0,"FY 2018":0,"FY 2019":0,"FY 2020":0}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(05) Equipment":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":6505,"spent":5864,"proposed":1000},"FY 2011":{"allotted":7505,"spent":6287,"proposed":1000},"FY 2012":{"allotted":8505,"spent":6332,"proposed":500},"FY 2013":{"allotted":9005,"spent":6379,"proposed":750},"FY 2014":{"allotted":9755,"spent":7364,"proposed":1000},"FY 2015":{"allotted":10755,"spent":8178,"proposed":500},"FY 2016":{"allotted":11255,"spent":8178,"new":500}}},"funding_by_source":{"Equipment Lease (0302)":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":6505,"spent":5864,"proposed":1000},"FY 2011":{"allotted":7505,"spent":6287,"proposed":1000},"FY 2012":{"allotted":8505,"spent":6332,"proposed":500},"FY 2013":{"allotted":9005,"spent":6379,"proposed":750},"FY 2014":{"allotted":9755,"spent":7364,"proposed":1000},"FY 2015":{"allotted":10755,"spent":8178,"proposed":500},"FY 2016":{"allotted":11255,"spent":8178,"new":500}}},"total_funding":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":6505,"spent":5864,"proposed":1000},"FY 2011":{"allotted":7505,"spent":6287,"proposed":1000},"FY 2012":{"allotted":8505,"spent":6332,"proposed":500},"FY 2013":{"allotted":9005,"spent":6379,"proposed":750},"FY 2014":{"allotted":9755,"spent":7364,"proposed":1000},"FY 2015":{"allotted":10755,"spent":8178,"proposed":500},"FY 2016":{"allotted":11255,"spent":8178,"new":500}}}}
