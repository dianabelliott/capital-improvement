The idea for a quick, efficient, low-cost, public-transit system originated in the National Capital Planning Commission's 1997 \"Extending the Legacy: Planning America's Capital for the 21st Century\" vision for the District.  This dynamic transit system promotes ease of movement in our world-class capital city and complements Metro's transit services throughout the region.    Now more than a decade after beginning operation, the DC Circulator is expanding to the National Mall.  DDOT is also working to deliver the Integrated Premium Transit program that will combine Circulator service, and bring successful elements of this program to the Districtâ€™s Streetcar system.    The project is the identification of a bus garage site for Circulator buses.  It includes preliminary engineering, design, and ultimately construction of a new facility or rehabilitation of an existing facility for that purpose.","justification":"The District anticipates a potential future need for a Circulator bus garage to support expanded service.","progress_assessment":"New project.","related_projects":"CIR14C-Circulator Buses; CIRFLC-Circulator Fleet Rehab","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{},"design_complete":{},"construction_start":{},"construction_complete":{},"closeout":{}},"est_cost":41203000,"lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2015,"last_year":2020,"cip_history":{"FY 2015":{"FY 2015":0,"FY 2016":2056,"FY 2017":0,"FY 2018":0,"FY 2019":13049,"FY 2020":13049}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(01) Design":{"FY 2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY 2016":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":2056},"FY 2017":{"allotted":2056,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY 2018":{"allotted":2056,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY 2019":{"allotted":2056,"spent":0,"proposed":13049},"FY 2020":{"allotted":15105,"spent":0,"proposed":13049}}},"funding_by_source":{"Pay Go (0301)":{"FY 2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY 2016":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":2056},"FY 2017":{"allotted":2056,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY 2018":{"allotted":2056,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY 2019":{"allotted":2056,"spent":0,"proposed":13049},"FY 2020":{"allotted":15105,"spent":0,"proposed":13049}}},"total_funding":{"FY 2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY 2016":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":2056},"FY 2017":{"allotted":2056,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY 2018":{"allotted":2056,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY 2019":{"allotted":2056,"spent":0,"proposed":13049},"FY 2020":{"allotted":15105,"spent":0,"proposed":13049}}}}
