The work funded by this pool includes: design costs for improvements; electrical, mechanical, plumbing, and energy upgrades; fire system upgrades; HVAC (to include heating, ventilation, air-conditioning systems); demolitions; rehabilitation of properties; new construction of permanent supportive and transistional housing and relocation of shelters for ohter development; and any capital needs related to improving property conditions.","justification":"This project is necessary to keep infrastructure of shelter properties intact. These properties are heavily-used District assets that are occupied year-round, and subject to significant wear and tear. There are a number of buildings that are in need of structural upgrades to maintain a well-working physical environment for our most vulnerable population. This project is an essential part of the Mayor’s initiative to ensure we meet quality of life standards for the District’s shelter population.","progress_assessment":"This is an ongoing pool project.","related_projects":"There are no projects related to this project.","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{},"design_complete":{},"construction_start":{},"construction_complete":{},"closeout":{}},"useful_life":30,"facility":"N/A","lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2010,"last_year":2011,"cip_history":{"FY 2010":{"FY 2010":2000,"FY 2011":5250,"FY 2012":5250,"FY 2013":10500,"FY 2014":10500,"FY 2015":10500},"FY 2011":{"FY 2011":5250,"FY 2012":5250,"FY 2013":5250,"FY 2014":5250,"FY 2015":5200,"FY 2016":5200}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(01) Design":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":47639,"spent":39601,"proposed":2000},"FY 2011":{"allotted":49639,"spent":46382,"proposed":5250}},"(02) SITE":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":14077,"spent":12783,"proposed":0},"FY 2011":{"allotted":13354,"spent":12793,"proposed":0}},"(03) Project Management":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":3994,"spent":2755,"proposed":0},"FY 2011":{"allotted":3844,"spent":2897,"proposed":1150}},"(04) Construction":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":21926,"spent":19388,"proposed":2000},"FY 2011":{"allotted":25149,"spent":24958,"proposed":2950}},"(05) Equipment":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":150,"spent":0,"proposed":0}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":45139,"spent":44677,"proposed":2000},"FY 2011":{"allotted":47139,"spent":44263,"proposed":5250}},"Pay Go (0301)":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":2500,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY 2011":{"allotted":2500,"spent":2500,"proposed":0}}},"total_funding":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":47639,"spent":39601,"proposed":2000},"FY 2011":{"allotted":49639,"spent":46382,"proposed":5250}}},"est_cost":54889}
