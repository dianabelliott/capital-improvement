{"active":true,"project_no":"TRL50","title":"TRAILS","agency":"DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION (KA0)","implementing_agency":"DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION (KA0)","ward":"","location":"DISTICT-WIDE","facility":"TRAILS","status":"New","description":"This project will construct trails throughout the District. The trails are: Rock Creek, Met Branch, South Capitol Street, Oxon Run, Suitland, and New York Avenue. The scope includes design and construction, or reconstruction, of trail facilities. It includes the implementation of stormwater management facilities, and the acquisition of property (if required for project implementation).","justification":"Bicycling has been increasing at a rate of 20 percent each year for the past five years. Trail construction provides opportunities for transportation, exercise, neighborhood, and economic development. Also, trail construction creates more jobs per dollar spent than other construction projects. Federal transportation funding for trails may be limited in the future. Funding this proposal with local dollars will help ensure that the District meets the transportation needs of residents.","progress_assessment":"This is a new project.","related_projects":"N/A","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{},"design_complete":{},"construction_start":{},"construction_complete":{},"closeout":{}},"est_cost":6000000,"useful_life":30,"lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2014,"last_year":2016,"cip_history":{"FY 2014":{"FY 2014":1000,"FY 2015":2500,"FY 2016":2500,"FY 2017":0,"FY 2018":0,"FY 2019":0},"FY 2015":{"FY 2015":2500,"FY 2016":2500,"FY 2017":0,"FY 2018":0,"FY 2019":0,"FY 2020":0}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(01) Design":{"FY 2014":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":1000},"FY 2015":{"allotted":1000,"spent":0,"proposed":2500},"FY 2016":{"allotted":3500,"spent":0,"proposed":2500}},"(04) Construction":{"FY 2014":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY 2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":1800},"FY 2016":{"allotted":1800,"spent":0,"proposed":2500}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY 2014":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":1000},"FY 2015":{"allotted":1000,"spent":0,"proposed":2500},"FY 2016":{"allotted":3500,"spent":0,"proposed":2500}}},"total_funding":{"FY 2014":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":1000},"FY 2015":{"allotted":1000,"spent":0,"proposed":2500},"FY 2016":{"allotted":3500,"spent":0,"proposed":2500}}}}
