Facility condition assessments of District buildings will identify specific improvements and upgrades with the potential to reduce consumption and achieve maximum savings. With energy costs continuing to increase, the District can realize savings – or offset increases – with appropriate retrofitting of public facilities to help reduce consumption.","justification":"This project directly supports the comprehensive plan goal to provide adequate public facilities and to support cost-effective and environmentally conscious delivery of municipal programs and services.","progress_assessment":"The project is progressing as planned.","related_projects":"BC101C/PL902C Condition assessment activity. After conducting facility assessments, this pool can provide budget to proactively enhance all energy systems in a facility.","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{"projected":"10/01/09","actual":"03/01/10"},"design_complete":{"projected":"03/01/10","actual":"03/01/10"},"construction_start":{"projected":"08/01/10","actual":"08/01/10"},"construction_complete":{"projected":"01/01/16"},"closeout":{"projected":"09/30/16"}},"useful_life":30,"facility":"ENERGY RETROFITS","ward":"","est_cost":52728000,"lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2010,"last_year":2020,"cip_history":{"FY 2010":{"FY 2010":1000,"FY 2011":1000,"FY 2012":1000,"FY 2013":1000,"FY 2014":1000,"FY 2015":1000},"FY 2011":{"FY 2011":1000,"FY 2012":1000,"FY 2013":1000,"FY 2014":500,"FY 2015":500,"FY 2016":1000},"FY 2012":{"FY 2012":8140,"FY 2013":2000,"FY 2014":500,"FY 2015":500,"FY 2016":1000,"FY 2017":0},"FY 2013":{"FY 2013":8900,"FY 2014":1500,"FY 2015":1500,"FY 2016":1000,"FY 2017":0,"FY 2018":0},"FY 2014":{"FY 2014":5000,"FY 2015":5000,"FY 2016":5000,"FY 2017":5000,"FY 2018":5000,"FY 2019":5000},"FY 2015":{"FY 2015":5000,"FY 2016":5000,"FY 2017":5000,"FY 2018":5000,"FY 2019":5000,"FY 2020":5000}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(01) Design":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":1000},"FY 2011":{"allotted":1000,"spent":49,"proposed":1000},"FY 2012":{"allotted":2000,"spent":1596,"proposed":8140},"FY 2013":{"allotted":10140,"spent":8459,"proposed":8900},"FY 2014":{"allotted":17910,"spent":12773,"proposed":5000},"FY 2015":{"allotted":18648,"spent":17935,"proposed":5000},"FY 2016":{"allotted":23648,"spent":17935,"proposed":5000},"FY 2017":{"allotted":28648,"spent":17935,"proposed":5000},"FY 2018":{"allotted":33648,"spent":17935,"proposed":5000},"FY 2019":{"allotted":38648,"spent":17935,"proposed":5000},"FY 2020":{"allotted":43648,"spent":17935,"proposed":5000}},"(03) Project Management":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":100},"FY 2011":{"allotted":100,"spent":0,"proposed":100},"FY 2012":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":100},"FY 2013":{"allotted":100,"spent":-150,"proposed":100},"FY 2014":{"allotted":200,"spent":100,"proposed":0},"FY 2015":{"allotted":100,"spent":100,"proposed":0},"FY 2016":{"allotted":100,"spent":100,"proposed":0},"FY 2017":{"allotted":100,"spent":100,"proposed":0},"FY 2018":{"allotted":100,"spent":100,"proposed":0},"FY 2019":{"allotted":100,"spent":100,"proposed":0},"FY 2020":{"allotted":100,"spent":100,"proposed":0}},"(04) Construction":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":500},"FY 2011":{"allotted":100,"spent":0,"proposed":614},"FY 2012":{"allotted":1309,"spent":1121,"proposed":7632},"FY 2013":{"allotted":8940,"spent":7722,"proposed":8586},"FY 2014":{"allotted":14007,"spent":9632,"proposed":4892},"FY 2015":{"allotted":14637,"spent":14476,"proposed":4612},"FY 2016":{"allotted":19249,"spent":14476,"proposed":5000},"FY 2017":{"allotted":24249,"spent":14476,"proposed":5000},"FY 2018":{"allotted":29249,"spent":14476,"proposed":5000},"FY 2019":{"allotted":34249,"spent":14476,"proposed":5000},"FY 2020":{"allotted":39249,"spent":14476,"proposed":5000}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds -
