{"active":true,"project_no":"SA306","title":"H ST/BENNING/K ST. LINE","agency":"DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION (KA0)","implementing_agency":"DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION (KA0)","location":"H STREET - BENNING RD NE - K STREET NW","status":"In multiple phases","description":"The DC Streetcar project is an initiative to increase the number of surface transit options for people who live, work, and visit the District of Columbia. It is anticipated that by 2030 a comprehensive streetcar network will operate in conjunction with the Circulator, Metro Extra rapid bus, and bus rapid transit to complement the current Metro bus and rail system. Current funding levels are based on a first phase 22 mile system and will support the completion of the H Street/Benning Road Line between the intersection of North Capitol Street and H Street, N.E. on the west and the Anacostia River on the east.  § 9-1173 of the DC Code limits expansion or construction of aerial wire-powered streetcar transit until the Mayor submits an aerial wire plan, hearings are held, and the Council approves the plan by resolution.  Included in this project is the full replacement of the H Street Bridge, which shall have funding priority.  Depending on the need for aerial wires and aerial wire plan approval, funding in this project may be also used to extend the H Street/Benning Road Line.  Funding for other lines is budgeted in related projects.","justification":"The current Metro bus/rail system is nearing capacity. Surface transit options are needed to complement the Metro system and connect all District neighborhoods with efficient, reliable and affordable means of public transportation. Capital funding for the streetcar addresses the jobs and economic opportunity section of the Mayor’s priorities. District tax payers will benefit from connectivity afforded by the project to underserved areas of the city and to foster economic development east of the Anacostia River. This project aligns with Sustainable DC Action: Transportation 1.1.","progress_assessment":"DDOT is completing the H Street / Benning Phase through the electrification of the existing tracks, the constructions of termini, and the construction of a maintenance facility.","related_projects":"The streetcar network is also budgeted in the following projects:  CD054A -
