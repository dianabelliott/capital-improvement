It is customized to follow all District laws and regulations and handles both union and non-union employees.","justification":"This account is used to fund software development & integration projects that serve multiple agencies and the public (such as online job applications). It also is used to fund numerous new top priority projects identified by the District leadership team. This is the key funding source for enhancements to the District's PeopleSoft Human Capital Management System.  Operating costs are reduced by 1) eliminating DCHR’s, OCFO’, and other District agencies’ IT support and maintenance costs for its stand-alone applications and processes (paper or otherwise), 2) streamlining HCM operations for the entire District from job application all the way to separation from employment, 3) promoting self-service requests initiated by employees, 4) integrating with internal and external systems and vendors including benefits carriers, and 5) promoting paper less technologies for Personnel Action Forms, Paystubs, and W-2s thus reducing amount of printed paper.","progress_assessment":"This project is progressing as planned through excellent stakeholder involvement and effective project management","related_projects":"None","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{"projected":"12/01/07","actual":"01/15/08"},"design_complete":{"projected":"11/15/10","actual":"11/15/10"},"construction_start":{"projected":"04/01/08","actual":"04/01/08"},"construction_complete":{"projected":"06/30/20"},"closeout":{"projected":"08/30/20"}},"useful_life":5,"facility":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY","ward":"","est_cost":13816000,"lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2010,"last_year":2015,"cip_history":{"FY 2010":{"FY 2010":1275,"FY 2011":1379,"FY 2012":1379,"FY 2013":1379,"FY 2014":1893,"FY 2015":950},"FY 2011":{"FY 2011":1379,"FY 2012":1000,"FY 2013":1000,"FY 2014":947,"FY 2015":475,"FY 2016":0},"FY 2012":{"FY 2012":500,"FY 2013":500,"FY 2014":947,"FY 2015":475,"FY 2016":0,"FY 2017":679},"FY 2013":{"FY 2013":0,"FY 2014":947,"FY 2015":475,"FY 2016":0,"FY 2017":679,"FY 2018":500},"FY 2014":{"FY 2014":947,"FY 2015":475,"FY 2016":0,"FY 2017":0,"FY 2018":0,"FY 2019":0},"FY 2015":{"FY 2015":3475,"FY 2016":0,"FY 2017":0,"FY 2018":0,"FY 2019":0,"FY 2020":0}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(07) IT Development & Testing":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":5635,"spent":5417,"proposed":1275},"FY 2011":{"allotted":6910,"spent":6820,"proposed":1379},"FY 2013":{"allotted":8789,"spent":8477,"proposed":0},"FY 2014":{"allotted":8894,"spent":8894,"proposed":947},"FY 2015":{"allotted":10341,"spent":10341,"proposed":3475}},"(07) IT Development Testing":{"FY 2012":{"allotted":8289,"spent":8215,"proposed":500}}},"funding_by_source":{"Equipment Lease (0302)":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":5635,"spent":5417,"proposed":1275},"FY 2011":{"allotted":6910,"spent":6820,"proposed":1379},"FY 2012":{"allotted":8289,"spent":8215,"proposed":500},"FY 2013":{"allotted":8789,"spent":8477,"proposed":0},"FY 2014":{"allotted":8894,"spent":8894,"proposed":947},"FY 2015":{"allotted":10341,"spent":10341,"proposed":3475}}},"total_funding":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":5635,"spent":5417,"proposed":1275},"FY 2011":{"allotted":6910,"spent":6820,"proposed":1379},"FY 2013":{"allotted":8789,"spent":8477,"proposed":0},"FY 2014":{"allotted":8894,"spent":8894,"proposed":947},"FY 2015":{"allotted":10341,"spent":10341,"proposed":3475},"FY 2012":{"allotted":8289,"spent":8215,"proposed":500}}}}
