{"active":true,"project_no":"CIR14","title":"CIRCULATOR BUSES","agency":"DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION (KA0)","implementing_agency":"DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION (KA0)","ward":"","location":"DISTRICT-WIDE","facility":"BUSES","status":"Ongoing Subprojects","description":"This project will fund the purchase of Circulator buses needed for the following service expansions:    (a) Extend the Rosslyn/Georgetown/Dupont Line to serve Adams Morgan, U Street, Shaw and Howard University.  (b) Extend the Union Station/Georgetown Line to the National Cathedral.  (c) Extend the Union Station/Navy Yard Line to the Southwest Waterfront.","justification":"DDOT projects that extending the Rosslyn/Georgetown/Dupont Circle Circulator line to Adams Morgan, U Street, Howard University, and Shaw would attract more than 500,000 new passengers to the Circulator.  A large number of Georgetown University employees live in Shaw.  The Union Station/Georgetown line extension to the National Cathedral is on DDOT's priority list.  It would make one of the District’s most popular tourist attractions more accessible. It would also provide additional bus service along a dense residential and commercial corridor that is not served by Metrorail. Extending the Union Station / Navy Yard route one mile to the Southwest Waterfront Metro station would connect two rapidly developing neighborhoods and link the Waterfront with Metrorail’s Red Line.","progress_assessment":"Ongoing project.","related_projects":"CIRFLC-Circulator Fleet Rehab; CIRBG-DBOM Circulator Bus Garage","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{},"design_complete":{},"construction_start":{},"construction_complete":{},"closeout":{}},"est_cost":56640000,"lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2014,"last_year":2019,"cip_history":{"FY 2014":{"FY 2014":4725,"FY 2015":0,"FY 2016":0,"FY 2017":0,"FY 2018":0,"FY 2019":0},"FY 2015":{"FY 2015":7702,"FY 2016":17012,"FY 2017":17600,"FY 2018":0,"FY 2019":7100,"FY 2020":0}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(01) Design":{"FY 2014":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":4725},"FY 2015":{"allotted":7225,"spent":0,"proposed":7702},"FY 2016":{"allotted":14927,"spent":0,"proposed":17012},"FY 2017":{"allotted":31939,"spent":0,"proposed":17600},"FY 2018":{"allotted":49539,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY 2019":{"allotted":49539,"spent":0,"proposed":7100}},"(04) Construction":{"FY 2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY 2016":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":590},"FY 2017":{"allotted":590,"spent":0,"proposed":2552},"FY 2018":{"allotted":3142,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY 2019":{"allotted":3142,"spent":0,"proposed":7100}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY 2014":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":4725},"FY 2015":{"allotted":4725,"spent":0,"proposed":7702},"FY 2016":{"allotted":12427,"spent":0,"proposed":16422},"FY 2017":{"allotted":28849,"spent":0,"proposed":15048},"FY 2018":{"allotted":43897,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY 2019":{"allotted":43897,"spent":0,"proposed":0}},"Pay Go (0301)":{"FY 2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY 2016":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":590},"FY 2017":{"allotted":590,"spent":0,"proposed":2552},"FY 2018":{"allotted":3142,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY 2019":{"allotted":3142,"spent":0,"proposed":7100}},"Local Transportation Revenue (0330)":{"FY 2015":{"allotted":2500,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY 2016":{"allotted":2500,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY 2017":{"allotted":2500,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY 2018":{"allotted":2500,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY 2019":{"allotted":2500,"spent":0,"proposed":0}}},"total_funding":{"FY 2014":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":4725},"FY 2015":{"allotted":7225,"spent":0,"proposed":7702},"FY 2016":{"allotted":14927,"spent":0,"proposed":17012},"FY 2017":{"allotted":31939,"spent":0,"proposed":17600},"FY 2018":{"allotted":49539,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY 2019":{"allotted":49539,"spent":0,"proposed":7100}}}}
