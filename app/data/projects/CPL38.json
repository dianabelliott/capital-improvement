The facility will meet the needs outlined in the five focus areas of library activity envisioned by DCPL, as a service to children and teens; library as a community place; books and other library materials; technology; and adult literacy and learning. The project will also consist of providing between 3,500 to 5,000 square feet of interim/temporary/swing space in order to assure continued library services during construction activities.     The renovated Cleveland Park Neighborhood Library will reflect the program and goals of the library and the needs of the District of Columbia residents who use it. The building will incorporate forward-thinking approaches to urban design, architecture, engineering and environmental technologies in the public realm. The renovated Cleveland Park Library will be a destination that will attract and support hundreds of users per day, and promote a vibrant, mixed-use neighborhood and active street environment.","justification":"The renovation will bring the building up to all current building codes and ADA regulations. This project aligns with Sustainable DC Action: Built Environment 3.5.","progress_assessment":"The Cleveland Park Library is contingent upon the results of the Master Facility Study.","related_projects":"There is potential to redevelop the library in partnership with a commercial venture to be located on the site.","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{"projected":"09/30/13"},"design_start":{"projected":"10/01/10"},"design_complete":{"projected":"09/30/14"},"construction_start":{"projected":"10/01/14"},"construction_complete":{"projected":"01/30/16"},"closeout":{"projected":"03/15/17"}},"est_cost":18670000,"useful_life":30,"lat":38.9338158,"lon":-77.05784258,"first_year":2012,"last_year":2017,"cip_history":{"FY 2012":{"FY 2012":0,"FY 2013":0,"FY 2014":0,"FY 2015":0,"FY 2016":0,"FY 2017":2300},"FY 2013":{"FY 2013":0,"FY 2014":0,"FY 2015":0,"FY 2016":0,"FY 2017":2300,"FY 2018":0},"FY 2014":{"FY 2014":0,"FY 2015":5225,"FY 2016":10000,"FY 2017":0,"FY 2018":0,"FY 2019":0},"FY 2015":{"FY 2015":5625,"FY 2016":12595,"FY 2017":450,"FY 2018":0,"FY 2019":0,"FY 2020":0}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(01) Design":{"FY 2012":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY 2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":5625},"FY 2016":{"allotted":5625,"spent":0,"proposed":12595},"FY 2017":{"allotted":18220,"spent":0,"proposed":450}},"(02) SITE":{"FY 2012":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY 2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY 2016":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":445},"FY 2017":{"allotted":445,"spent":0,"proposed":0}},"(03) Project Management":{"FY 2012":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY 2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":3919},"FY 2016":{"allotted":3919,"spent":0,"proposed":1600},"FY 2017":{"allotted":5519,"spent":0,"proposed":0}},"(04) Construction":{"FY 2013":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY 2014":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY 2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY 2016":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":10550},"FY 2017":{"allotted":10550,"spent":0,"proposed":450}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY 2012":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY 2014":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY 2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":5625},"FY 2016":{"allotted":5625,"spent":0,"proposed":12595},"FY 2017":{"allotted":18220,"spent":0,"proposed":450}},"Sales of Assets (0305)":{"FY 2013":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0}}},"total_funding":{"FY 2012":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY 2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":5625},"FY 2016":{"allotted":5625,"spent":0,"proposed":12595},"FY 2017":{"allotted":18220,"spent":0,"proposed":450},"FY 2013":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY 2014":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0}}}}
