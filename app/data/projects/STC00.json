The DC Streetcar will make travel within the District much easier for residents, workers and visitors, and it will complement the existing transit options. Although the Metrorail system does an exemplary job of connecting the District to the rest of the region, it was not designed to connect neighborhoods. The DC Streetcar will do that and it will bring tremendous benefits to the communities it serves.  In addition to streetcar lines under construction on H Street NE and Anacostia, planning is underway for additional segments across the city.","related_projects":"THE STREETCAR NETWORK IS ALSO BUDGETED IN THE FOLLOWING PROJECTS:  CD054A - H STREET BRIDGE OVER AMTRAK, CM080A - STREETCAR NEPA BENNING RD, CM081A - STREETCAR NEPA MLK AVE, FDT08A - LIGHT RAIL DEMO LINE, KA0 PROJECT SA306C- H T/BENNING/K ST LINE, KEO PROJECT SA306C â€“ STREETCARS, SA307C - ANACOSTIA LINE, SA308C - STREETCAR VEHICLES, SR075A - K STREET TRANSITWAY, STC11A - STREETCAR OPERATIONS, STC12A - UNION STATION TO WASHINGTON CIRCLE, STC13A - DC STREETCAR NORTH SOUTH LINE STUDY, STC14A, DC STREETCAR BOLLING EXTENSION","lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2012,"last_year":2020,"cip_history":{"FY 2012":{"FY 2012":9,"FY 2013":0,"FY 2014":0,"FY 2015":0,"FY 2016":0,"FY 2017":0},"FY 2013":{"FY 2013":7215,"FY 2014":8262,"FY 2015":16903,"FY 2016":18113,"FY 2017":2686,"FY 2018":3665},"FY 2014":{"FY 2014":0,"FY 2015":0,"FY 2016":0,"FY 2017":8163,"FY 2018":15845,"FY 2019":0},"FY 2015":{"FY 2015":10110,"FY 2016":5159,"FY 2017":6153,"FY 2018":22406,"FY 2019":24229,"FY 2020":5896}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(03) Project Management":{"FY 2012":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":9},"FY 2013":{"allotted":9,"spent":0,"proposed":7215},"FY 2014":{"allotted":9,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY 2015":{"allotted":1224,"spent":0,"proposed":10110},"FY 2016":{"allotted":11334,"spent":0,"proposed":5159},"FY 2017":{"allotted":16493,"spent":0,"proposed":6153},"FY 2018":{"allotted":22646,"spent":0,"proposed":22406},"FY 2019":{"allotted":45052,"spent":0,"proposed":24229},"FY 2020":{"allotted":69281,"spent":0,"proposed":5896}},"(04) Construction":{"FY 2013":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":7215},"FY 2014":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY 2015":{"allotted":1215,"spent":0,"proposed":10110},"FY 2016":{"allotted":11325,"spent":0,"proposed":5159},"FY 2017":{"allotted":16484,"spent":0,"proposed":6153},"FY 2018":{"allotted":22637,"spent":0,"proposed":22406},"FY 2019":{"allotted":45043,"spent":0,"proposed":24229},"FY 2020":{"allotted":69272,"spent":0,"proposed":5896}}},"funding_by_source":{"Highway Trust Fund (0320)":{"FY 2012":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":2},"FY 2013":{"allotted":2,"spent":0,"proposed":1576},"FY 2014":{"allotted":2,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY 2015":{"allotted":578,"spent":0,"proposed":1906},"FY 2016":{"allotted":2484,"spent":0,"proposed":1049},"FY 2017":{"allotted":3533,"spent":0,"proposed":1164},"FY 2018":{"allotted":4697,"spent":0,"proposed":4176},"FY 2019":{"allotted":8873,"spent":0,"proposed":4168},"FY 2020":{"allotted":13041,"spent":0,"proposed":1014}},"Federal (0350)":{"FY 2012":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":8},"FY 2013":{"allotted":8,"spent":0,"proposed":5639},"FY 2014":{"allotted":8,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY 2015":{"allotted":647,"spent":0,"proposed":8204},"FY 2016":{"allotted":8851,"spent":0,"proposed":4110},"FY 2017":{"allotted":12961,"spent":0,"proposed":4989},"FY 2018":{"allotted":17950,"spent":0,"proposed":18230},"FY 2019":{"allotted":36180,"spent":0,"proposed":20061},"FY 2020":{"allotted":56241,"spent":0,"proposed":4882}}},"total_funding":{"FY 2012":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":9},"FY 2013":{"allotted":9,"spent":0,"proposed":7215},"FY 2014":{"allotted":9,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY 2015":{"allotted":1224,"spent":0,"proposed":10110},"FY 2016":{"allotted":11334,"spent":0,"proposed":5159},"FY 2017":{"allotted":16493,"spent":0,"proposed":6153},"FY 2018":{"allotted":22646,"spent":0,"proposed":22406},"FY 2019":{"allotted":45052,"spent":0,"proposed":24229},"FY 2020":{"allotted":69281,"spent":0,"proposed":5896}}},"est_cost":75177}
