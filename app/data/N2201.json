This project allows OCTO to maintain a robust virtual server pool, which has the dual benefit of providing modern equipment to improve application performance, as well as decreasing the overall operating cost of the data centers due to a decrease in the need for physical servers. Virtual server pools can be defined as taking one physical server and making it appear as many servers on the network.","justification":"This project allows for the continuous improvement of OCTO’s virtual server pool. This technology eliminates the need for costly 1-to-1 mapping of production and Disaster Recovery servers.   This project ensures the availability of critical services that OCTO provides to the entire District. The demand on the virtual server platform increases every year and a refresh of equipment allows OCTO to meet new demand and handle the current load. The servers in this virtual pool host critical applications for agencies.","progress_assessment":"This project is progressing as planned. In FY2012 deployment for additional hardware and software will continue to further consolidate the dispersed and redundant server technologies throughout the District.","related_projects":"N2504-SERVER CONSOLIDATION - GO BOND","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{"projected":"09/30/2007","actual":"10/01/2006"},"design_complete":{"projected":"09/30/2014","actual":"09/30/2014"},"construction_start":{"projected":"09/30/2007","actual":"09/30/2007"},"construction_complete":{"projected":"09/30/2020"},"closeout":{"projected":"09/30/2020"}},"useful_life":10,"facility":"DATA CENTER","est_cost":4248000,"lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2010,"last_year":2015,"cip_history":{"FY 2010":{"FY 2010":0,"FY 2011":0,"FY 2012":0,"FY 2013":0,"FY 2014":0,"FY 2015":500},"FY 2011":{"FY 2011":0,"FY 2012":0,"FY 2013":0,"FY 2014":0,"FY 2015":250,"FY 2016":5000},"FY 2012":{"FY 2012":0,"FY 2013":0,"FY 2014":0,"FY 2015":250,"FY 2016":4000,"FY 2017":155},"FY 2013":{"FY 2013":0,"FY 2014":0,"FY 2015":250,"FY 2016":3000,"FY 2017":155,"FY 2018":0},"FY 2014":{"FY 2014":0,"FY 2015":250,"FY 2016":0,"FY 2017":0,"FY 2018":0,"FY 2019":0},"FY 2015":{"FY 2015":250,"FY 2016":0,"FY 2017":0,"FY 2018":0,"FY 2019":0,"FY 2020":0}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(05) Equipment":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":4000,"spent":2821,"proposed":0},"FY 2011":{"allotted":4000,"spent":3773,"proposed":0},"FY 2012":{"allotted":4000,"spent":3915,"proposed":0},"FY 2013":{"allotted":4000,"spent":3921,"proposed":0},"FY 2014":{"allotted":4000,"spent":3978,"proposed":0},"FY 2015":{"allotted":3998,"spent":3998,"proposed":250}}},"funding_by_source":{"Equipment Lease (0302)":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":4000,"spent":2821,"proposed":0},"FY 2011":{"allotted":4000,"spent":3773,"proposed":0},"FY 2012":{"allotted":4000,"spent":3915,"proposed":0},"FY 2013":{"allotted":4000,"spent":3921,"proposed":0},"FY 2014":{"allotted":4000,"spent":3978,"proposed":0},"FY 2015":{"allotted":3998,"spent":3998,"proposed":250}}},"total_funding":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":4000,"spent":2821,"proposed":0},"FY 2011":{"allotted":4000,"spent":3773,"proposed":0},"FY 2012":{"allotted":4000,"spent":3915,"proposed":0},"FY 2013":{"allotted":4000,"spent":3921,"proposed":0},"FY 2014":{"allotted":4000,"spent":3978,"proposed":0},"FY 2015":{"allotted":3998,"spent":3998,"proposed":250}}}}
