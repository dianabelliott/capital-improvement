These assets are also essential for the well-being of businesses, commuters, and pedestrians.     DDOT's multi-year performance-based contract maintains the District's lighting assets.  The contractor is responsible for managing all lighting assets within public space, including alleys and streetlights, highways, underpasses, tunnels, bridges, navigation lights, overhead guide signs, and “Welcome to Washington, DC” signs.  A number of lighting systems and the electrical control systems for the Frederick Douglas Bridge are also included.      In this performance-based asset preservation contract, the desired outcome is specified rather than the means and methods: the contractor is instructed what to achieve, not how to achieve it.  The District requires that the contractor meet a set of performance standards for all assets and DDOT personnel conduct citywide monthly and annual inspections to measure the contractor’s performance.  DDOT personnel also monitor the contractor’s response for repair requests and schedules daily.  The contract includes both incentives and disincentives for failing or exceeding these performance measures.  The asset contractor has improved the lighting performance by reducing outages from a high of 20 percent two years ago (FY07) to less one percent this year (FY09).     This project also includes upgrades to lighting assets, including the conversion of traditional lighting to high efficiency LED technology. The project also funds staff who implement this program.","justification":"This project is necessary for the safety of District residents and drivers.  The performance-based contract has proven to be the most cost-effective way to ensure that the District’s streetlights are illuminating the streets. This project aligns with SustainableDC Action: Nature 2.2 and Energy 1.3.","progress_assessment":"The contract is progressing as planned. This contract has improved the District’s lighting system by reducing outages and other unsafe conditions thus resulting in improved customer satisfaction as compared to previous years.","related_projects":"The maintenance and upgrade of lighting assets on federal aid-eligible streets, bridges, and tunnels in funded through the Federal -aid (FHWA) program.","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{},"design_complete":{},"construction_start":{"actual":"05/01/2006"},"construction_complete":{"projected":"05/01/2011"},"closeout":{}},"useful_life":10,"ward":"","facility":"LOCAL STREETS","est_cost":141115000,"lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2010,"last_year":2020,"cip_history":{"FY 2010":{"FY 2010":10256,"FY 2011":10256,"FY 2012":10256,"FY 2013":10256,"FY 2014":10256,"FY 2015":10256},"FY 2011":{"FY 2011":10256,"FY 2012":10256,"FY 2013":10256,"FY 2014":5128,"FY 2015":5000,"FY 2016":10256},"FY 2012":{"FY 2012":10256,"FY 2013":10256,"FY 2014":10256,"FY 2015":10256,"FY 2016":10256,"FY 2017":10256},"FY 2013":{"FY 2013":8757,"FY 2014":10256,"FY 2015":10256,"FY 2016":10256,"FY 2017":10256,"FY 2018":10256},"FY 2014":{"FY 2014":8617,"FY 2015":9256,"FY 2016":9256,"FY 2017":10256,"FY 2018":9256,"FY 2019":9256},"FY 2015":{"FY 2015":8656,"FY 2016":9256,"FY 2017":10256,"FY 2018":9000,"FY 2019":9256,"FY 2020":9256}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(03) Project Management":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":6982,"spent":863,"proposed":10256},"FY 2011":{"allotted":34025,"spent":30003,"proposed":10256},"FY 2012":{"allotted":61519,"spent":48439,"proposed":10256},"FY 2013":{"allotted":70060,"spent":59243,"proposed":8757},"FY 2014":{"allotted":78817,"spent":68397,"proposed":8617},"FY 2015":{"allotted":85435,"spent":73636,"proposed":8656},"FY 2016":{"allotted":94091,"spent":73636,"new":9256},"FY 2017":{"allotted":103347,"spent":73636,"new":10256},"FY 2018":{"allotted":113603,"spent":73636,"new":9000},"FY 2019":{"allotted":122603,"spent":73636,"new":9256},"FY 2020":{"allotted":131859,"spent":73636,"new":9256}},"(04) Construction":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":6831,"spent":486,"proposed":10256},"FY 2011":{"allotted":31972,"spent":20056,"proposed":8944},"FY 2012":{"allotted":56956,"spent":45096,"proposed":8107},"FY 2013":{"allotted":63652,"spent":55619,"proposed":6870},"FY 2014":{"allotted":70529,"spent":61367,"proposed":6000},"FY 2015":{"allotted":76346,"spent":66113,"proposed":8000},"FY 2016":{"allotted":84346,"spent":66113,"new":8000},"FY 2017":{"allotted":92346,"spent":66113,"new":10000},"FY 2018":{"allotted":102346,"spent":66113,"new":9000},"FY 2019":{"allotted":111346,"spent":66113,"new":9000},"FY 2020":{"allotted":120346,"spent":66113,"new":9000}},"(01) Design":{"FY 2011":{"allotted":100,"spent":93,"proposed":0},"FY 2012":{"allotted":100,"spent":93,"proposed":0},"FY 2013":{"allotted":100,"spent":93,"proposed":0},"FY 2014":{"allotted":293,"spent":93,"proposed":0},"FY 2015":{"allotted":293,"spent":136,"proposed":0},"FY 2016":{"allotted":293,"spent":136,"new":0},"FY 2017":{"allotted":293,"spent":136,"new":0},"FY 2018":{"allotted":293,"spent":136,"new":0},"FY 2019":{"allotted":293,"spent":136,"new":0},"FY 2020":{"allotted":293,"spent":136,"new":0}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds -
