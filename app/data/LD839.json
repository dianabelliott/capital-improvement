Some of the current issues facing the academy include environmental remediation from the of burning flammable/combustible liquids, severely deteriorated roadways, live overhead utility wires in outdated and nonoperational fire training props within the facility.  Additionally, there are a multitude of facility and utility issues with the building and lot.    The project will upgrade all systems for underground utilities, electric, sewer, gas (both natural and LP), water distribution , fire hydrants, electrical conduits, and street lighting.  New utilities will be placed to accomodate future improvements and safety hazards will be remediated through the relocation of overhead wiring hazards, removal of storage tanks, pipes and other equipment.  All aging and non-operational fire training props, including the underground water and oil separator will be removed.  Finally, there will be an installation of a new perimeter security fence, access gate, street improvements and a driving training course.","justification":"This project is necessary to bring the Emergency Vehicle Operators Course up to the latest industry standards for our Emergency Vehicle Operators.
