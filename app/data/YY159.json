The existing building is undersized to meet the school’s current needs and it is envisioned that new space will need to be added as an “inѕfill” addition in order to fully meet programmatic requirements, creating a total building square footage of approximately 165,000. The renovated facility will serve approximately 600 students and will serve as a regional magnet school for the performing arts. DGS is seeking firms that exhibit design excellence that are capable of transforming the school building into an icon for the performing arts while respecting the historic character of the existing building.","justification":"This project was included in the Master Facilities Plan adopted by Section 4111 of the Fiscal Year 2011 Budget Support Act of 2010.
