This project is a US District Court and Department of Justice-monitored project.","progress_assessment":"This project is experiencing time delays due to unanticipated obstacles, including contaminated soil, and plan improvements such as additional communications and technology infrastructure.","related_projects":"Project XA537C - St Elizabeths Hospital General Improvements.Milestone Data Projected Actual Environmental Approvals Design Start (FY) Design Complete (FY) 09/30/2006 09/30/2006 Construction Start (FY) 12/01/2006 Construction Complete (FY) 09/30/2010 Closeout (FY) 11/30/2010","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{},"design_complete":{"projected":"09/30/2006","actual":"09/30/2006"},"construction_start":{"projected":"12/01/2006"},"construction_complete":{"projected":"09/30/2010"},"closeout":{"projected":"11/30/2010"}},"useful_life":50,"facility":"NEW MENTAL HEALTH HOSPITAL","lat":38.85068463,"lon":-76.99472857,"first_year":2010,"last_year":2011,"cip_history":{"FY 2010":{"FY 2010":12770,"FY 2011":0,"FY 2012":0,"FY 2013":0,"FY 2014":0,"FY 2015":0},"FY 2011":{"FY 2011":12500,"FY 2012":0,"FY 2013":0,"FY 2014":0,"FY 2015":0,"FY 2016":0}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(03) Project Management":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":213480,"spent":163036,"proposed":12770},"FY 2011":{"allotted":218490,"spent":190555,"proposed":12500}},"(04) Construction":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":188701,"spent":149524,"proposed":0},"FY 2011":{"allotted":180941,"spent":169149,"proposed":12500}},"(05) Equipment":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":7485,"spent":49,"proposed":12770},"FY 2011":{"allotted":20255,"spent":5372,"proposed":0}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":34800,"spent":8096,"proposed":12770},"FY 2011":{"allotted":39810,"spent":18036,"proposed":12500}},"Certificate of Participation (0340)":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":178679,"spent":154940,"proposed":0},"FY 2011":{"allotted":178679,"spent":172520,"proposed":0}}},"total_funding":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":213480,"spent":163036,"proposed":12770},"FY 2011":{"allotted":218490,"spent":190555,"proposed":12500}}}}
