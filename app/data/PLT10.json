Palantir was designed for environments where the fragments of data that an analyst combines to tell the larger story are spread across a vast set of starting material.  Palantir provides flexible tools to import and model data, intuitive constructs to search against this data, and powerful techniques to iteratively define and test hypotheses.","justification":"Today, MPD members must log into numerous individual systems and manually integrate the data to perform analysis.  This process is time-intensive, manual, and vulnerable to errors. Analytical products are not always completed within the desired timeframes. Palantir will enable timely data mining and analysis.","progress_assessment":"This is a new project.","related_projects":"There are no related projects.","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{"projected":"04/01/2013"},"design_complete":{},"construction_start":{},"construction_complete":{},"closeout":{"projected":"09/30/2014"}},"est_cost":2500000,"useful_life":5,"lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2014,"last_year":2014,"cip_history":{"FY 2014":{"FY 2014":2500,"FY 2015":0,"FY 2016":0,"FY 2017":0,"FY 2018":0,"FY 2019":0}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(06) IT Requirements Development/Systems Design":{"FY 2014":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":2500}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY 2014":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":2500}}},"total_funding":{"FY 2014":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":2500}}}}
