The project will catalyze the redevelopment of Upper Georgia Ave by taking down the previously gated campus and creating new mixed-use opportunities along this key gateway into the District.","justification":"The District Government, as the local redevelopment authority formally recognized by the US Department of Defense, has undertaken the responsibility of developing a homeless accommodation and reuse plan for the 62.5 acre surplus portion of the WRAMC.  The costs for this project are 90% funded by a federal grant from the Department of Defense with a 10% District match. Under BRAC law, each LRA is required to submit its reuse and homeless plan to HUD 270 days from the submission deadline for all notices of interest.  For WRAMC, that deadline was November 30, 2010. Successful implementation of the plan will result in an integration of this 60+ acres into the community making the over 40+ acres of green/open space available to the community.  The proposed commercial development is estimated to result in annual tax revenues in excess of $18 million. The proposed reuse plan is consistent with the comprehensive plan and incorporates policy priorities of the Mayor. This project aligns with Sustainable DC Action: Water 3.3.","progress_assessment":"The project is progressing as planned.","related_projects":"Fire and Emergency Medical Services project LC437C-Engine 22 Firehouse Replacement.","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{"projected":"08/20/2014"},"design_start":{"projected":"07/01/2011"},"design_complete":{"projected":"06/01/2012"},"construction_start":{"projected":"11/01/2014"},"construction_complete":{"projected":"11/01/2019"},"closeout":{}},"est_cost":4798000,"useful_life":30,"lat":38.97658194,"lon":-77.02884996,"first_year":2013,"last_year":2015,"cip_history":{"FY 2013":{"FY 2013":1000,"FY 2014":0,"FY 2015":0,"FY 2016":0,"FY 2017":0,"FY 2018":0},"FY 2014":{"FY 2014":1000,"FY 2015":1300,"FY 2016":0,"FY 2017":0,"FY 2018":0,"FY 2019":0},"FY 2015":{"FY 2015":1300,"FY 2016":0,"FY 2017":0,"FY 2018":0,"FY 2019":0,"FY 2020":0}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(04) Construction":{"FY 2013":{"allotted":1498,"spent":1498,"proposed":1000},"FY 2014":{"allotted":2498,"spent":690,"proposed":1000},"FY 2015":{"allotted":3498,"spent":1220,"proposed":1300}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY 2013":{"allotted":1498,"spent":1498,"proposed":1000},"FY 2014":{"allotted":2498,"spent":690,"proposed":1000},"FY 2015":{"allotted":3498,"spent":1220,"proposed":1300}}},"total_funding":{"FY 2013":{"allotted":1498,"spent":1498,"proposed":1000},"FY 2014":{"allotted":2498,"spent":690,"proposed":1000},"FY 2015":{"allotted":3498,"spent":1220,"proposed":1300}}}}
