Spanning the Anacostia River, the park would link Historic Anacostia with the Navy Yard. Preliminary plans include bike and pedestrian trails, outdoor performance spaces, play areas, gardens, information about the river and its ecosystem, a dock to launch boats and kayaks to explore the river.","justification":"A large, diverse group of stakeholders, led by THEARC in Ward 8 and with the assistance of DDOT, has been working to develop plans for this park.  They expect to raise 50% of the $25 million projected cost for construction from private  donors.","progress_assessment":"New project.","related_projects":"N/A","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{"projected":"10/01/2014"},"design_complete":{"projected":"09/30/2015"},"construction_start":{"projected":"10/01/2015"},"construction_complete":{"projected":"09/30/2017"},"closeout":{"projected":"09/30/2017"}},"est_cost":28100000,"useful_life":30,"lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2015,"last_year":2017,"cip_history":{"FY 2015":{"FY 2015":3100,"FY 2016":12500,"FY 2017":12500,"FY 2018":0,"FY 2019":0,"FY 2020":0}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(01) Design":{"FY 2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":3100},"FY 2016":{"allotted":3100,"spent":0,"new":12500},"FY 2017":{"allotted":15600,"spent":0,"new":12500}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY 2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":2000},"FY 2016":{"allotted":2000,"spent":0,"new":6250},"FY 2017":{"allotted":8250,"spent":0,"new":6250}},"Capital Fund - Federal Contribut (0345)":{"FY 2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":1100},"FY 2016":{"allotted":1100,"spent":0,"new":6250},"FY 2017":{"allotted":7350,"spent":0,"new":6250}}},"total_funding":{"FY 2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":3100},"FY 2016":{"allotted":3100,"spent":0,"new":12500},"FY 2017":{"allotted":15600,"spent":0,"new":12500}}}}
