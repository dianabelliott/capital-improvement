The proposed scope of work for this project is roof replacement, new windows, painting through out the facility, refurbishing the existing floors, upgrading the existing kitchen including new appliances, and upgrading the electrical, plumbing, and HVAC systems in the facility.","justification":"The existing facility has a very active community with a large number of successful programs, such as boxing, for the youth in the community. However, the existing facility is not meeting the needs of the community. Many of the programs are held in areas that are not safe and are deteriorating. DPR feels that itâ€™s essential that the department be advocates for improving all our facilities, especially those with the most needs such as Bald Eagle.","progress_assessment":"This project will be implemented in partnership with OPEFM.
