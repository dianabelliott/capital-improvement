The Deputy Mayor for Education’s Student Assignment and DCPS School Boundaries Review process recommends the construction of four new middle schools, including two in Ward 4.  Ward 4’s only DCPS middle school was closed in 2013. Population trends demonstrate the need for new middle schools in northern and southern Ward 4. This project will ensure that at least one new middle school is constructed in Ward 4.","justification":"The dearth of excellent DC middle schools is unsustainable and unjust.  The scramble for good middle schools has left Alice Deal Middle School in Northwest overcrowded and strained.   All middle school students across the city should have access to the kinds of opportunities currently available at Deal.","progress_assessment":"New project.","related_projects":"NA","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{"projected":"10/01/2014"},"design_complete":{"projected":"09/30/2015"},"construction_start":{"projected":"10/01/2015"},"construction_complete":{"projected":"09/30/2017"},"closeout":{"projected":"09/30/2017"}},"est_cost":7000000,"useful_life":30,"lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2015,"last_year":2015,"cip_history":{"FY 2015":{"FY 2015":7000,"FY 2016":0,"FY 2017":0,"FY 2018":0,"FY 2019":0,"FY 2020":0}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(01) Design":{"FY 2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":7000}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY 2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":7000}}},"total_funding":{"FY 2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":7000}}}}
