The 11th Street Bridges design build project represents a significant step forward in DDOT ’s Anacostia Waterfront Initiative infrastructure endeavor. The project will improve mobility by providing separate freeway and local traffic connections to area roadways. Providing these connections will allow for the creation of the  “Grand Urban Boulevard” envisioned for the South Capitol Street Corridor. The project provides multi-modal transportation options for cars, pedestrians, bicycles, and the future DC Streetcar; replaces existing structures that are both functionally deficient and structurally obsolete; provides an additional alternate evacuation route from our Nation’s Capital; and supports the overall environmental mission of the Anacostia Waterfront Initiative. The first phase of the innovative design build to budget project started construction in December 2009, and is scheduled to be completed in 2013. This project is the largest project ever completed by DDOT and is the first river bridge replacement in the District of Columbia in more than 40 years. Completing this project will improve travel for both local and regional traffic.","related_projects":"All projects assigned to master project HTF00A-11th Street Bridge in Appendix H, Table 3.","useful_life":70,"lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2012,"last_year":2020,"cip_history":{"FY 2012":{"FY 2012":7051,"FY 2013":7052,"FY 2014":7053,"FY 2015":7053,"FY 2016":7052,"FY 2017":7824},"FY 2013":{"FY 2013":34322,"FY 2014":32366,"FY 2015":25046,"FY 2016":11667,"FY 2017":11674,"FY 2018":11674},"FY 2014":{"FY 2014":36498,"FY 2015":19268,"FY 2016":11770,"FY 2017":11773,"FY 2018":11772,"FY 2019":11771},"FY 2015":{"FY 2015":21768,"FY 2016":16770,"FY 2017":11774,"FY 2018":11772,"FY 2019":11771,"FY 2020":11771}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(04) Construction":{"FY 2012":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":7051},"FY 2013":{"allotted":18000,"spent":0,"proposed":34322},"FY 2014":{"allotted":5161,"spent":0,"proposed":36498},"FY 2015":{"allotted":9644,"spent":0,"proposed":21768},"FY 2016":{"allotted":31412,"spent":0,"new":16770},"FY 2017":{"allotted":48182,"spent":0,"new":11774},"FY 2018":{"allotted":59956,"spent":0,"new":11772},"FY 2019":{"allotted":71728,"spent":0,"new":11771},"FY 2020":{"allotted":83499,"spent":0,"new":11771}},"(03) Project Management":{"FY 2013":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":1058},"FY 2015":{"allotted":958,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY 2016":{"allotted":958,"spent":0,"new":0},"FY 2017":{"allotted":958,"spent":0,"new":0},"FY 2018":{"allotted":958,"spent":0,"new":0},"FY 2019":{"allotted":958,"spent":0,"new":0},"FY 2020":{"allotted":958,"spent":0,"new":0}}},"funding_by_source":{"Federal (0350)":{"FY 2012":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":7051},"FY 2013":{"allotted":14400,"spent":0,"proposed":28545},"FY 2014":{"allotted":3258,"spent":0,"proposed":36051},"FY 2015":{"allotted":9016,"spent":0,"proposed":21768},"FY 2016":{"allotted":30784,"spent":0,"new":16770},"FY 2017":{"allotted":47554,"spent":0,"new":11774},"FY 2018":{"allotted":59328,"spent":0,"new":11772},"FY 2019":{"allotted":71100,"spent":0,"new":11771},"FY 2020":{"allotted":82871,"spent":0,"new":11771}},"Highway Trust Fund (0320)":{"FY 2013":{"allotted":3600,"spent":0,"proposed":5777},"FY 2014":{"allotted":1904,"spent":0,"proposed":447},"FY 2015":{"allotted":628,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY 2016":{"allotted":628,"spent":0,"new":0},"FY 2017":{"allotted":628,"spent":0,"new":0},"FY 2018":{"allotted":628,"spent":0,"new":0},"FY 2019":{"allotted":628,"spent":0,"new":0},"FY 2020":{"allotted":628,"spent":0,"new":0}}},"total_funding":{"FY 2012":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":7051},"FY 2013":{"allotted":18000,"spent":0,"proposed":34322},"FY 2014":{"allotted":5161,"spent":0,"proposed":36498},"FY 2015":{"allotted":9644,"spent":0,"proposed":21768},"FY 2016":{"allotted":31412,"spent":0,"new":16770},"FY 2017":{"allotted":48182,"spent":0,"new":11774},"FY 2018":{"allotted":59956,"spent":0,"new":11772},"FY 2019":{"allotted":71728,"spent":0,"new":11771},"FY 2020":{"allotted":83499,"spent":0,"new":11771}}}}
