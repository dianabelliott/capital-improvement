The work will include the complete demolition and removal of the original recruit training building and temporary trailer building replacements.  Site work, grading, paving and utility upgrades that will be necessary with the new building are also included. This project will also allow for the completion of the new traffic flow pattern outlined in the Training Academy Master Plan.","justification":"The Training Academy recruit building was built in 1960. It has long out lived its life expectancy. It does not have the classroom size or necessary infrastructure to support a proper learning environment. FIRE & EMS has recently hired a large number of employees in order to bring the Department to full strength. The Department plans to continue to maintain this level of hiring for years to come. FIRE & EMS is also working with MPD to possibly have a combined Training Academy.","progress_assessment":"This project is in the design phase.","related_projects":"There is no project related to this project.","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{"projected":"04/01/2011","actual":"10/01/2007"},"design_complete":{"projected":"04/01/2016"},"construction_start":{},"construction_complete":{},"closeout":{"projected":"06/03/2017"}},"useful_life":50,"facility":"FIRE & EMS TRAINING ACADEMY","est_cost":12000000,"lat":38.82053486,"lon":-77.01608052,"first_year":2010,"last_year":2013,"cip_history":{"FY 2010":{"FY 2010":250,"FY 2011":990,"FY 2012":2500,"FY 2013":4720,"FY 2014":6200,"FY 2015":3240},"FY 2011":{"FY 2011":250,"FY 2012":2500,"FY 2013":0,"FY 2014":3100,"FY 2015":3100,"FY 2016":3240},"FY 2012":{"FY 2012":0,"FY 2013":2500,"FY 2014":3100,"FY 2015":3100,"FY 2016":3240,"FY 2017":0},"FY 2013":{"FY 2013":500,"FY 2014":3100,"FY 2015":5100,"FY 2016":3240,"FY 2017":0,"FY 2018":0}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(01) Design":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":500,"spent":0,"proposed":250},"FY 2011":{"allotted":750,"spent":294,"proposed":250},"FY 2012":{"allotted":629,"spent":571,"proposed":0}},"(03) Project Management":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":150,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY 2011":{"allotted":150,"spent":0,"proposed":0}},"(04) Construction":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":250},"FY 2011":{"allotted":250,"spent":96,"proposed":250},"FY 2012":{"allotted":279,"spent":221,"proposed":0},"FY 2013":{"allotted":58,"spent":0,"proposed":500}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":500,"spent":0,"proposed":250},"FY 2011":{"allotted":750,"spent":294,"proposed":250},"FY 2012":{"allotted":629,"spent":571,"proposed":0},"FY 2013":{"allotted":58,"spent":0,"proposed":500}}},"total_funding":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":500,"spent":0,"proposed":250},"FY 2011":{"allotted":750,"spent":294,"proposed":250},"FY 2012":{"allotted":629,"spent":571,"proposed":0},"FY 2013":{"allotted":58,"spent":0,"proposed":500}}}}
