{"active":true,"project_no":"CA303","title":"KA0-CA303-STORMWATER MANAGEMENT","agency":"DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION (KA0)","implementing_agency":"DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION (KA0)","location":"DISTRICT-WIDE","status":"Ongoing Subprojects","description":"This project repairs and maintains culverts throughout the District. Culverts facilitate the drainage of water and help to ensure the stabilization of roadway structures. The safety of roadway structures is a priority of the Mayor, and a concern for District residents, commuters, and visitors. This project also maintains an inventory for all the culverts owned and maintained by the District Department of Transportation (DDOT) and a formal maintenance and repair plan.","justification":"This project is necessary because of its safety impact on roadways.  Because culverts support roadway structures, the lack of drainage provided by culverts could have a severe impact on the functionality and safety on roads. This project aligns with SustainableDC Action: Water 2.2.","progress_assessment":"DDOT’s inventory system maintains a systematic and comprehensive evaluation process which allows for routine maintenance and scheduled repairs.  This, in conjunction with DDOT’s bridge inspection program, provides preventative safety measures on the District’s bridges and culverts.","related_projects":"DDOT has a federal-aid bridge inspection program that inspects the District’s bridges.","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{},"design_complete":{},"construction_start":{},"construction_complete":{},"closeout":{}},"useful_life":30,"ward":"","est_cost":7887000,"facility":"LOCAL STREETS","lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2011,"last_year":2020,"cip_history":{"FY 2011":{"FY 2011":400,"FY 2012":400,"FY 2013":400,"FY 2014":400,"FY 2015":400,"FY 2016":400},"FY 2012":{"FY 2012":400,"FY 2013":300,"FY 2014":300,"FY 2015":300,"FY 2016":300,"FY 2017":250},"FY 2013":{"FY 2013":300,"FY 2014":300,"FY 2015":300,"FY 2016":300,"FY 2017":300,"FY 2018":300},"FY 2014":{"FY 2014":250,"FY 2015":250,"FY 2016":250,"FY 2017":250,"FY 2018":250,"FY 2019":250},"FY 2015":{"FY 2015":250,"FY 2016":250,"FY 2017":250,"FY 2018":0,"FY 2019":250,"FY 2020":250}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(01) Design":{"FY 2011":{"allotted":3926,"spent":2723,"proposed":400},"FY 2012":{"allotted":5087,"spent":4219,"proposed":400},"FY 2013":{"allotted":5488,"spent":4948,"proposed":300},"FY 2014":{"allotted":6387,"spent":5604,"proposed":250},"FY 2015":{"allotted":6637,"spent":6180,"proposed":250},"FY 2016":{"allotted":6887,"spent":6180,"new":250},"FY 2017":{"allotted":7137,"spent":6180,"new":250},"FY 2018":{"allotted":7387,"spent":6180,"new":0},"FY 2019":{"allotted":7387,"spent":6180,"new":250},"FY 2020":{"allotted":7637,"spent":6180,"new":250}},"(03) Project Management":{"FY 2011":{"allotted":993,"spent":585,"proposed":0},"FY 2012":{"allotted":1433,"spent":1258,"proposed":124},"FY 2013":{"allotted":1857,"spent":1600,"proposed":106},"FY 2014":{"allotted":2682,"spent":2256,"proposed":250},"FY 2015":{"allotted":2932,"spent":2788,"proposed":129},"FY 2016":{"allotted":3061,"spent":2788,"new":250},"FY 2017":{"allotted":3311,"spent":2788,"new":250},"FY 2018":{"allotted":3561,"spent":2788,"new":0},"FY 2019":{"allotted":3561,"spent":2788,"new":250},"FY 2020":{"allotted":3811,"spent":2788,"new":250}},"(04) Construction":{"FY 2011":{"allotted":2753,"spent":1891,"proposed":400},"FY 2012":{"allotted":3317,"spent":2557,"proposed":276},"FY 2013":{"allotted":3227,"spent":2944,"proposed":194},"FY 2014":{"allotted":3301,"spent":2944,"proposed":0},"FY 2015":{"allotted":3301,"spent":2988,"proposed":121},"FY 2016":{"allotted":3422,"spent":2988,"new":0},"FY 2017":{"allotted":3422,"spent":2988,"new":0},"FY 2018":{"allotted":3422,"spent":2988,"new":0},"FY 2019":{"allotted":3422,"spent":2988,"new":0},"FY 2020":{"allotted":3422,"spent":2988,"new":0}}},"funding_by_source":{"Local Street Main (0330)":{"FY 2011":{"allotted":3926,"spent":2724,"proposed":400}},"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY 2012":{"allotted":761,"spent":761,"proposed":0},"FY 2013":{"allotted":761,"spent":761,"proposed":300},"FY 2014":{"allotted":1661,"spent":957,"proposed":250},"FY 2015":{"allotted":1911,"spent":1423,"proposed":250},"FY 2016":{"allotted":2161,"spent":1423,"new":250},"FY 2017":{"allotted":2411,"spent":1423,"new":250},"FY 2018":{"allotted":2661,"spent":1423,"new":0},"FY 2019":{"allotted":2661,"spent":1423,"new":0},"FY 2020":{"allotted":2661,"spent":1423,"new":0}},"Local Transportation Revenue (0330)":{"FY 2012":{"allotted":4326,"spent":3457,"proposed":400},"FY 2013":{"allotted":4726,"spent":4187,"proposed":0},"FY 2014":{"allotted":4726,"spent":4647,"proposed":0},"FY 2015":{"allotted":4726,"spent":4757,"proposed":0},"FY 2016":{"allotted":4726,"spent":4757,"new":0},"FY 2017":{"allotted":4726,"spent":4757,"new":0},"FY 2018":{"allotted":4726,"spent":4757,"new":0},"FY 2019":{"allotted":4726,"spent":4757,"new":0},"FY 2020":{"allotted":4726,"spent":4757,"new":0}},"Pay Go (0301)":{"FY 2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY 2016":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"new":0},"FY 2017":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"new":0},"FY 2018":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"new":0},"FY 2019":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"new":250},"FY 2020":{"allotted":250,"spent":0,"new":250}}},"total_funding":{"FY 2011":{"allotted":3926,"spent":2723,"proposed":400},"FY 2012":{"allotted":5087,"spent":4219,"proposed":400},"FY 2013":{"allotted":5488,"spent":4948,"proposed":300},"FY 2014":{"allotted":6387,"spent":5604,"proposed":250},"FY 2015":{"allotted":6637,"spent":6180,"proposed":250},"FY 2016":{"allotted":6887,"spent":6180,"new":250},"FY 2017":{"allotted":7137,"spent":6180,"new":250},"FY 2018":{"allotted":7387,"spent":6180,"new":0},"FY 2019":{"allotted":7387,"spent":6180,"new":250},"FY 2020":{"allotted":7637,"spent":6180,"new":250}}}}
