These application schools are located in Wards 1, 2, and 5.  Students living in other wards must travel to these wards to avail themselves of the best academic opportunities offered in the city.  Half of the DCPS application schools enroll at least one third of their students from Wards 7 and 8.  If we want to encourage and promote development of high achieving Wards 7 and 8 students, we need to provide them with educational opportunities in their own communities that will challenge them and reward their hard work.","progress_assessment":"New project.","related_projects":"NA","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{"projected":"10/01/14"},"design_complete":{"projected":"09/30/15"},"construction_start":{"projected":"10/01/15"},"construction_complete":{"projected":"09/30/17"},"closeout":{"projected":"09/30/17"}},"est_cost":8000000,"useful_life":30,"lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2015,"last_year":2015,"cip_history":{"FY 2015":{"FY 2015":8000,"FY 2016":0,"FY 2017":0,"FY 2018":0,"FY 2019":0,"FY 2020":0}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(04) Construction":{"FY 2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":8000}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY 2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":8000}}},"total_funding":{"FY 2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":8000}}}}
