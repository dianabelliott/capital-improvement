DRES anticipates a full project cost of approximately $375 million to fully modernize the facility. This will include hazardous material abatement, historical resoration work, comprehensive systems upgrades (elevators, electrical, HVAC, security, IT) reconfiguration of the basement parking area, and LEED certification. Although strategies for fully funding this massive capital improvement are currently being explored (such as potential federal or public-private partnerships) the immediate needs of the facility require planning to begin in early FY 2011 and select work to commence in FY 2012 and FY 2013.","justification":"The Daly building is several years beyond its useful life. A full rehabilitation is required to preserve this historic District asset, in order to maximize its efficiency as a Public Safety Headquarters.","progress_assessment":"Project is in planning stage.","related_projects":"None Milestone Data Projected Actual Environmental Approvals 01/01/2011 Design Start (FY) 01/01/2011 Design Complete (FY) 01/01/2013 01/01/2013 Construction Start (FY) 01/01/2013 Construction Complete (FY) 01/01/2015 Closeout (FY) 01/01/2016","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{"projected":"01/01/2011"},"design_start":{"projected":"01/01/2011"},"design_complete":{"projected":"01/01/2013","actual":"01/01/2013"},"construction_start":{"projected":"01/01/2013"},"construction_complete":{"projected":"01/01/2015"},"closeout":{"projected":"01/01/2016"}},"useful_life":30,"facility":"DALY BUILDING","lat":38.89431379,"lon":-77.01654233,"first_year":2010,"last_year":2011,"cip_history":{"FY 2010":{"FY 2010":0,"FY 2011":0,"FY 2012":5000,"FY 2013":15000,"FY 2014":30000,"FY 2015":25000},"FY 2011":{"FY 2011":0,"FY 2012":0,"FY 2013":5000,"FY 2014":5000,"FY 2015":5000,"FY 2016":0}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(01) Design":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY 2011":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0}},"(03) Project Management":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY 2011":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0}},"(04) Construction":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY 2011":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY 2011":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0}}},"total_funding":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY 2011":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0}}}}
