Funding is needed to characterize the sediments in the entire estuary area of the Anacostia and develop a cleanup remedy. The sediments are an on-going source of contaminants and need to be addressed before the Anacostia can be returned to a “fishable and swimmable” river. Testing needs to be conducted on Anacostia sediment and water toxins (when present) to determine proper clean-up methods and potentially isolate the source of contamination from the clean-up sites.","progress_assessment":"Ongoing.","related_projects":"Department of General Services project PL103C-HAZARDOUS MATERIAL ABATEMENT POOL","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{"projected":"10/01/2011"},"design_start":{"projected":"03/01/2012"},"design_complete":{"projected":"05/31/2012"},"construction_start":{"projected":"12/01/2012"},"construction_complete":{"projected":"09/30/2020"},"closeout":{"projected":"12/31/2021"}},"est_cost":47990000,"useful_life":30,"lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2012,"last_year":2020,"cip_history":{"FY 2012":{"FY 2012":0,"FY 2013":0,"FY 2014":0,"FY 2015":25000,"FY 2016":25000,"FY 2017":24000},"FY 2013":{"FY 2013":1500,"FY 2014":3500,"FY 2015":15000,"FY 2016":15000,"FY 2017":13500,"FY 2018":0},"FY 2014":{"FY 2014":1500,"FY 2015":15000,"FY 2016":15000,"FY 2017":10000,"FY 2018":0,"FY 2019":0},"FY 2015":{"FY 2015":6000,"FY 2016":15000,"FY 2017":10000,"FY 2018":0,"FY 2019":4500,"FY 2020":9500}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(04) Construction":{"FY 2012":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY 2013":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":1500},"FY 2014":{"allotted":1015,"spent":10,"proposed":1500},"FY 2015":{"allotted":2990,"spent":1178,"proposed":6000},"FY 2016":{"allotted":8990,"spent":1178,"new":15000},"FY 2017":{"allotted":23990,"spent":1178,"new":10000},"FY 2018":{"allotted":33990,"spent":1178,"new":0},"FY 2019":{"allotted":33990,"spent":1178,"new":4500},"FY 2020":{"allotted":38490,"spent":1178,"new":9500}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY 2012":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY 2013":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":1500},"FY 2014":{"allotted":1015,"spent":10,"proposed":1500},"FY 2015":{"allotted":2515,"spent":1178,"proposed":6000},"FY 2016":{"allotted":8515,"spent":1178,"new":15000},"FY 2017":{"allotted":23515,"spent":1178,"new":10000},"FY 2018":{"allotted":33515,"spent":1178,"new":0},"FY 2019":{"allotted":33515,"spent":1178,"new":0},"FY 2020":{"allotted":33515,"spent":1178,"new":0}},"Pay Go (0301)":{"FY 2012":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY 2013":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY 2015":{"allotted":475,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY 2016":{"allotted":475,"spent":0,"new":0},"FY 2017":{"allotted":475,"spent":0,"new":0},"FY 2018":{"allotted":475,"spent":0,"new":0},"FY 2019":{"allotted":475,"spent":0,"new":4500},"FY 2020":{"allotted":4975,"spent":0,"new":9500}}},"total_funding":{"FY 2012":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY 2013":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":1500},"FY 2014":{"allotted":1015,"spent":10,"proposed":1500},"FY 2015":{"allotted":2990,"spent":1178,"proposed":6000},"FY 2016":{"allotted":8990,"spent":1178,"new":15000},"FY 2017":{"allotted":23990,"spent":1178,"new":10000},"FY 2018":{"allotted":33990,"spent":1178,"new":0},"FY 2019":{"allotted":33990,"spent":1178,"new":4500},"FY 2020":{"allotted":38490,"spent":1178,"new":9500}}}}
