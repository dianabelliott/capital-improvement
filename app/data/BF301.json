The current District General Ledger system is based on 20 year old technology.  Supporting this technology is becoming ever more complicated since the resources and skill-sets needed to support a mainframe based system are not easily available.  Moreover, the current General Ledger system lacks functionality found in modern systems necessary to support real-time financial management and allow the OCFO to provide greater integration with other key District systems such as the cash management system, budgeting systems, Human Resources and Payroll systems, and the tax systems.","progress_assessment":"The project budget was first allotted in FY 2007, and all requirements assessment activities have been completed.  The project development has occurred, and testing is well underway. The project is currently scheduled to be implemented beginning FY 2013.","related_projects":"All core financial systems in the District are tightly integrated and interrelated.  The OCFO is in the process of modernizing and implementing all core financial systems to bring these systems in line with current industry trends and District stakeholder needs","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{},"design_complete":{"projected":"03/30/2011"},"construction_start":{"projected":"09/30/2011"},"construction_complete":{"projected":"10/01/2020"},"closeout":{"projected":"05/01/2021"}},"useful_life":10,"facility":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY","est_cost":80056000,"lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2010,"last_year":2020,"cip_history":{"FY 2010":{"FY 2010":2000,"FY 2011":3000,"FY 2012":0,"FY 2013":0,"FY 2014":0,"FY 2015":0},"FY 2011":{"FY 2011":3000,"FY 2012":3000,"FY 2013":0,"FY 2014":0,"FY 2015":0,"FY 2016":0},"FY 2013":{"FY 2013":2680,"FY 2014":0,"FY 2015":0,"FY 2016":0,"FY 2017":0,"FY 2018":0},"FY 2015":{"FY 2015":10000,"FY 2016":0,"FY 2017":0,"FY 2018":7000,"FY 2019":18500,"FY 2020":18500}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(05) Equipment":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":5000,"spent":322,"proposed":2000},"FY 2011":{"allotted":9836,"spent":437,"proposed":3000},"FY 2013":{"allotted":22376,"spent":11915,"proposed":2680},"FY 2015":{"allotted":26056,"spent":13457,"proposed":10000},"FY 2016":{"allotted":36056,"spent":13457,"new":0},"FY 2017":{"allotted":36056,"spent":13457,"new":0},"FY 2018":{"allotted":36056,"spent":13457,"new":7000},"FY 2019":{"allotted":43056,"spent":13457,"new":18500},"FY 2020":{"allotted":61556,"spent":13457,"new":18500}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":5000,"spent":322,"proposed":2000},"FY 2011":{"allotted":9836,"spent":437,"proposed":3000},"FY 2013":{"allotted":21889,"spent":11435,"proposed":2680},"FY 2015":{"allotted":25569,"spent":12977,"proposed":10000},"FY 2016":{"allotted":35569,"spent":12977,"new":0},"FY 2017":{"allotted":35569,"spent":12977,"new":0},"FY 2018":{"allotted":35569,"spent":12977,"new":0},"FY 2019":{"allotted":35569,"spent":12977,"new":0},"FY 2020":{"allotted":35569,"spent":12977,"new":0}},"Pay Go (0301)":{"FY 2013":{"allotted":487,"spent":480,"proposed":0},"FY 2015":{"allotted":487,"spent":480,"proposed":0},"FY 2016":{"allotted":487,"spent":480,"new":0},"FY 2017":{"allotted":487,"spent":480,"new":0},"FY 2018":{"allotted":487,"spent":480,"new":7000},"FY 2019":{"allotted":7487,"spent":480,"new":18500},"FY 2020":{"allotted":25987,"spent":480,"new":18500}}},"total_funding":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":5000,"spent":322,"proposed":2000},"FY 2011":{"allotted":9836,"spent":437,"proposed":3000},"FY 2013":{"allotted":22376,"spent":11915,"proposed":2680},"FY 2015":{"allotted":26056,"spent":13457,"proposed":10000},"FY 2016":{"allotted":36056,"spent":13457,"new":0},"FY 2017":{"allotted":36056,"spent":13457,"new":0},"FY 2018":{"allotted":36056,"spent":13457,"new":7000},"FY 2019":{"allotted":43056,"spent":13457,"new":18500},"FY 2020":{"allotted":61556,"spent":13457,"new":18500}}}}
