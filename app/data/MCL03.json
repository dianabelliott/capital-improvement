MEMORIAL CENTRAL LIBRARY","image":"fy15-83_1.jpg","agency":"DC PUBLIC LIBRARY (CE0)","implementing_agency":"DC PUBLIC LIBRARY (CE0)","ward":"2","location":"901 G STREET NW","facility":"MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. MEMORIAL CENTRAL LIBRARY","status":"Under preliminary study","description":"The Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Central Library was designated as a National Historic Landmark in April 2007. The Library will receive a total renovation to improve services and modernize the space while being respectful of the historic nature of the building.  A new and reconfigured Business, Science and Technology Division will localize over 100 public access computers to this division. The project also includes funding to relocate and create a new eBIC space on the seldom used A-Level. The A-Level renovation will provide flexible space permitting multiple uses for either library programming, eBIC, University of the District of Columbia,  or Community College of DC; as well being available for community use.","justification":"The project is necessary because the existing Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library building does not meet the District's needs as a central library. This project aligns with SustainableDC Action: Built Environment 3.5.","progress_assessment":"Project is ongoing.","related_projects":"-","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{"projected":"09/06/2010"},"design_complete":{"projected":"08/29/2012"},"construction_start":{"projected":"01/28/2013"},"construction_complete":{"projected":"12/15/2020"},"closeout":{"projected":"01/31/2021"}},"useful_life":30,"est_cost":220000000,"lat":38.89869166,"lon":-77.02476625,"first_year":2011,"last_year":2020,"cip_history":{"FY 2011":{"FY 2011":901,"FY 2012":0,"FY 2013":0,"FY 2014":0,"FY 2015":0,"FY 2016":0},"FY 2012":{"FY 2012":2900,"FY 2013":1000,"FY 2014":500,"FY 2015":1000,"FY 2016":500,"FY 2017":1000},"FY 2013":{"FY 2013":1000,"FY 2014":0,"FY 2015":0,"FY 2016":0,"FY 2017":0,"FY 2018":0},"FY 2014":{"FY 2014":3000,"FY 2015":0,"FY 2016":0,"FY 2017":50000,"FY 2018":50000,"FY 2019":0},"FY 2015":{"FY 2015":14500,"FY 2016":0,"FY 2017":4500,"FY 2018":0,"FY 2019":76500,"FY 2020":113000}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(01) Design":{"FY 2011":{"allotted":319,"spent":281,"proposed":901},"FY 2012":{"allotted":1220,"spent":322,"proposed":2900},"FY 2013":{"allotted":5120,"spent":1032,"proposed":1000},"FY 2014":{"allotted":6120,"spent":4530,"proposed":3000},"FY 2015":{"allotted":9457,"spent":6415,"proposed":14500},"FY 2016":{"allotted":23957,"spent":6415,"new":0},"FY 2017":{"allotted":23957,"spent":6415,"new":4500},"FY 2018":{"allotted":28457,"spent":6415,"new":0},"FY 2019":{"allotted":28457,"spent":6415,"new":76500},"FY 2020":{"allotted":104957,"spent":6415,"new":113000}},"(03) Project Management":{"FY 2011":{"allotted":157,"spent":156,"proposed":0},"FY 2012":{"allotted":157,"spent":152,"proposed":0},"FY 2013":{"allotted":732,"spent":155,"proposed":52},"FY 2014":{"allotted":634,"spent":436,"proposed":0},"FY 2015":{"allotted":1281,"spent":905,"proposed":9500},"FY 2016":{"allotted":10781,"spent":905,"new":0},"FY 2017":{"allotted":10781,"spent":905,"new":4500},"FY 2018":{"allotted":15281,"spent":905,"new":0},"FY 2019":{"allotted":15281,"spent":905,"new":3552},"FY 2020":{"allotted":18833,"spent":905,"new":3552}},"(04) Construction":{"FY 2012":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":2900},"FY 2013":{"allotted":2800,"spent":28,"proposed":948},"FY 2014":{"allotted":3748,"spent":2695,"proposed":3000},"FY 2015":{"allotted":3933,"spent":3811,"proposed":0},"FY 2016":{"allotted":3933,"spent":3811,"new":0},"FY 2017":{"allotted":3933,"spent":3811,"new":0},"FY 2018":{"allotted":3933,"spent":3811,"new":0},"FY 2019":{"allotted":3933,"spent":3811,"new":72948},"FY 2020":{"allotted":76881,"spent":3811,"new":109448}},"(02) SITE":{"FY 2013":{"allotted":100,"spent":48,"proposed":0},"FY 2014":{"allotted":100,"spent":48,"proposed":0},"FY 2015":{"allotted":48,"spent":48,"proposed":0},"FY 2016":{"allotted":48,"spent":48,"new":0},"FY 2017":{"allotted":48,"spent":48,"new":0},"FY 2018":{"allotted":48,"spent":48,"new":0},"FY 2019":{"allotted":48,"spent":48,"new":0},"FY 2020":{"allotted":48,"spent":48,"new":0}},"(05) Equipment":{"FY 2014":{"allotted":150,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY 2015":{"allotted":25,"spent":1,"proposed":0},"FY 2016":{"allotted":25,"spent":1,"new":0},"FY 2017":{"allotted":25,"spent":1,"new":0},"FY 2018":{"allotted":25,"spent":1,"new":0},"FY 2019":{"allotted":25,"spent":1,"new":0},"FY 2020":{"allotted":25,"spent":1,"new":0}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY 2011":{"allotted":319,"spent":280,"proposed":901},"FY 2012":{"allotted":1220,"spent":322,"proposed":2900},"FY 2013":{"allotted":5120,"spent":1033,"proposed":1000},"FY 2014":{"allotted":6120,"spent":4531,"proposed":3000},"FY 2015":{"allotted":9457,"spent":6414,"proposed":14500},"FY 2016":{"allotted":23957,"spent":6414,"new":0},"FY 2017":{"allotted":23957,"spent":6414,"new":4500},"FY 2018":{"allotted":28457,"spent":6414,"new":0},"FY 2019":{"allotted":28457,"spent":6414,"new":76500},"FY 2020":{"allotted":104957,"spent":6414,"new":113000}}},"total_funding":{"FY 2011":{"allotted":319,"spent":281,"proposed":901},"FY 2012":{"allotted":1220,"spent":322,"proposed":2900},"FY 2013":{"allotted":5120,"spent":1032,"proposed":1000},"FY 2014":{"allotted":6120,"spent":4530,"proposed":3000},"FY 2015":{"allotted":9457,"spent":6415,"proposed":14500},"FY 2016":{"allotted":23957,"spent":6415,"new":0},"FY 2017":{"allotted":23957,"spent":6415,"new":4500},"FY 2018":{"allotted":28457,"spent":6415,"new":0},"FY 2019":{"allotted":28457,"spent":6415,"new":76500},"FY 2020":{"allotted":104957,"spent":6415,"new":113000}}}}
