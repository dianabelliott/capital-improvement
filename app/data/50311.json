OF HOUSING AND COMM. DEVELOPMENT (DB0)","ward":"7","location":"4739 ALABAMA AVENUE SE","status":"New","description":"This project will support the redevelopment of Benning Terrace to enhance earlier DCHA capital improvements and begin a more comprehensive redevelopment of the property, with some portions of the property intended for mixed income housing and one-to-one replacement of 112 public housing units. As such, the scope of services will be predevelopment planning and site infrastructure construction.","justification":"This property currently provides housing to 274 of the District’s low income residents. One-to-one replacement will ensure that the inventory of public housing units will remain at the same level. This development urgently needs total redevelopment. Redeveloping this site will also help incorporate the development into the neighborhood.","progress_assessment":"New project.","related_projects":"DCHA’s Glenncrest (HOPE VI) project is located across the street of the development. DHCD’s Amber Overlook (Woodson Heights) is also located adjacent to this project.
