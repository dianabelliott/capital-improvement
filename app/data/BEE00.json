The faster buses can travel, the fewer vehicles and drivers are needed along a route to maintain the same level of service, which saves the District money. WMATA has concluded that improving six bus corridors in the District would save the District $5,800,000 annually.  This project supplements and replaces the Sustainable Transportation Fund.","progress_assessment":"Ongoing project.","related_projects":"AF083C-16TH ST NW BUS PRIORITY IMPRVS, AF084C-GA AVE BUS PRIORITY IMPRVS, AF085C-H ST/BENNING RD BUS PRIORITY IMPRVS, AF086C-WI AVE BUS PRIORITY IMPRVS, AF087C-TR BRIDGE TO K ST BUS PRIORITY IMPRVS, AF088C-14TH ST BRIDGE TO K ST BUS PRIORITY IMPR.","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{},"design_complete":{},"construction_start":{},"construction_complete":{},"closeout":{}},"est_cost":5250000,"useful_life":15,"lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2014,"last_year":2020,"cip_history":{"FY 2014":{"FY 2014":750,"FY 2015":0,"FY 2016":0,"FY 2017":0,"FY 2018":0,"FY 2019":0},"FY 2015":{"FY 2015":750,"FY 2016":750,"FY 2017":750,"FY 2018":750,"FY 2019":750,"FY 2020":750}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(04) Construction":{"FY 2014":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":750},"FY 2015":{"allotted":750,"spent":451,"proposed":750},"FY 2016":{"allotted":1500,"spent":451,"proposed":750},"FY 2017":{"allotted":2250,"spent":451,"proposed":750},"FY 2018":{"allotted":3000,"spent":451,"proposed":750},"FY 2019":{"allotted":3750,"spent":451,"proposed":750},"FY 2020":{"allotted":4500,"spent":451,"proposed":750}}},"funding_by_source":{"Pay Go (0301)":{"FY 2014":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":750},"FY 2015":{"allotted":750,"spent":451,"proposed":0},"FY 2016":{"allotted":750,"spent":451,"proposed":0},"FY 2017":{"allotted":750,"spent":451,"proposed":0},"FY 2018":{"allotted":750,"spent":451,"proposed":0},"FY 2019":{"allotted":750,"spent":451,"proposed":0},"FY 2020":{"allotted":750,"spent":451,"proposed":0}},"Local Transportation Revenue (0330)":{"FY 2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":750},"FY 2016":{"allotted":750,"spent":0,"proposed":750},"FY 2017":{"allotted":1500,"spent":0,"proposed":750},"FY 2018":{"allotted":2250,"spent":0,"proposed":750},"FY 2019":{"allotted":3000,"spent":0,"proposed":750},"FY 2020":{"allotted":3750,"spent":0,"proposed":750}}},"total_funding":{"FY 2014":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":750},"FY 2015":{"allotted":750,"spent":451,"proposed":750},"FY 2016":{"allotted":1500,"spent":451,"proposed":750},"FY 2017":{"allotted":2250,"spent":451,"proposed":750},"FY 2018":{"allotted":3000,"spent":451,"proposed":750},"FY 2019":{"allotted":3750,"spent":451,"proposed":750},"FY 2020":{"allotted":4500,"spent":451,"proposed":750}}}}
