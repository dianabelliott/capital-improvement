Projects may include vehicles and vehicle parts, rail system infrastructure rehabilitation, maintenance facilities, systems and technology, track and structures, passenger facilities, maintenance equipment, other facilities, program management and support, safety and security projects, and preventive maintenance.  An annual contribution of $50 million will be made, contingent upon annual appropriation from Congress in the amount of $150 million along with $50 million annual appropriations from both the State of Maryland and the Commonwealth of Virginia.","justification":"This project is necessary to maintain the reliability of rail service.  Current WMATA capital spending levels are inadequate to maintain the system in a state of good repair and provide for continued growth in system use.  The additional $300 million per year in capital funding will allow WMATA to accelerate infrastructure repairs to maintain the system, replace the original subway cars in the system that are now at the end of their useful life, and proceed with system improvements such as power upgrades to accommodate longer trains and the purchase of new subway cars to accommodate ridership growth.","progress_assessment":"This project is on-going.","related_projects":"SA501C-WMATA CIP Contribution, SA502C-WMATA Momentum","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{},"design_complete":{},"construction_start":{},"construction_complete":{},"closeout":{}},"useful_life":30,"facility":"WMATA","ward":"","est_cost":506297000,"lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2010,"last_year":2020,"cip_history":{"FY 2010":{"FY 2010":50000,"FY 2011":50000,"FY 2012":25000,"FY 2013":25000,"FY 2014":50000,"FY 2015":50000},"FY 2011":{"FY 2011":50000,"FY 2012":50000,"FY 2013":50000,"FY 2014":50000,"FY 2015":50000,"FY 2016":50000},"FY 2012":{"FY 2012":50000,"FY 2013":50000,"FY 2014":50000,"FY 2015":50000,"FY 2016":50000,"FY 2017":50000},"FY 2013":{"FY 2013":50000,"FY 2014":50000,"FY 2015":50000,"FY 2016":50000,"FY 2017":50000,"FY 2018":43662},"FY 2014":{"FY 2014":50000,"FY 2015":50000,"FY 2016":50000,"FY 2017":50000,"FY 2018":50000,"FY 2019":50000},"FY 2015":{"FY 2015":50000,"FY 2016":50000,"FY 2017":50000,"FY 2018":50000,"FY 2019":50000,"FY 2020":50000}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(01) Design":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":50000},"FY 2011":{"allotted":12500,"spent":0,"proposed":50000},"FY 2012":{"allotted":56540,"spent":56540,"proposed":50000},"FY 2013":{"allotted":105638,"spent":94133,"proposed":50000},"FY 2014":{"allotted":155662,"spent":155662,"proposed":50000},"FY 2015":{"allotted":206237,"spent":206254,"proposed":50000},"FY 2016":{"allotted":256237,"spent":206254,"new":50000},"FY 2017":{"allotted":306237,"spent":206254,"new":50000},"FY 2018":{"allotted":356237,"spent":206254,"new":50000},"FY 2019":{"allotted":406237,"spent":206254,"new":50000},"FY 2020":{"allotted":456237,"spent":206254,"new":50000}},"(04) Construction":{"FY 2015":{"allotted":193,"spent":129,"proposed":0},"FY 2016":{"allotted":193,"spent":129,"new":0},"FY 2017":{"allotted":193,"spent":129,"new":0},"FY 2018":{"allotted":193,"spent":129,"new":0},"FY 2019":{"allotted":193,"spent":129,"new":0},"FY 2020":{"allotted":193,"spent":129,"new":0}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":50000},"FY 2011":{"allotted":12478,"spent":0,"proposed":47750},"FY 2012":{"allotted":56375,"spent":56375,"proposed":50000},"FY 2013":{"allotted":105470,"spent":93968,"proposed":50000},"FY 2014":{"allotted":155496,"spent":155496,"proposed":50000},"FY 2015":{"allotted":206071,"spent":206089,"proposed":50000},"FY 2016":{"allotted":256071,"spent":206089,"new":50000},"FY 2017":{"allotted":306071,"spent":206089,"new":50000},"FY 2018":{"allotted":356071,"spent":206089,"new":50000},"FY 2019":{"allotted":406071,"spent":206089,"new":50000},"FY 2020":{"allotted":456071,"spent":206089,"new":50000}},"Pay Go (0301)":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY 2011":{"allotted":22,"spent":0,"proposed":2250},"FY 2012":{"allotted":165,"spent":165,"proposed":0},"FY 2013":{"allotted":168,"spent":165,"proposed":0},"FY 2014":{"allotted":165,"spent":165,"proposed":0},"FY 2015":{"allotted":165,"spent":165,"proposed":0},"FY 2016":{"allotted":165,"spent":165,"new":0},"FY 2017":{"allotted":165,"spent":165,"new":0},"FY 2018":{"allotted":165,"spent":165,"new":0},"FY 2019":{"allotted":165,"spent":165,"new":0},"FY 2020":{"allotted":165,"spent":165,"new":0}}},"total_funding":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":50000},"FY 2011":{"allotted":12500,"spent":0,"proposed":50000},"FY 2012":{"allotted":56540,"spent":56540,"proposed":50000},"FY 2013":{"allotted":105638,"spent":94133,"proposed":50000},"FY 2014":{"allotted":155662,"spent":155662,"proposed":50000},"FY 2015":{"allotted":206237,"spent":206254,"proposed":50000},"FY 2016":{"allotted":256237,"spent":206254,"new":50000},"FY 2017":{"allotted":306237,"spent":206254,"new":50000},"FY 2018":{"allotted":356237,"spent":206254,"new":50000},"FY 2019":{"allotted":406237,"spent":206254,"new":50000},"FY 2020":{"allotted":456237,"spent":206254,"new":50000}}}}
