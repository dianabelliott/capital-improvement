Specifically, this project makes the essential upgrades needed to maintain adequate public facilities.  Among the capital improvements required in District-owned facilities are roof replacements, window replacements, and HVAC (heating and air-conditioning systems) replacements.  In addition, this project can be used for priority building improvement projects that may have not been planned for as part of the facilities condition assessment.  Even with excellent planning, there is often a need to address critical infrastructure needs in District buildings.","justification":"This project will allow for maximum use of capital improvement pool funding by allowing proactive planning, maximizing the efficiency of upgrades, and permitting flexibility in delivering facility improvements.  It is essential to ensure that proper capital investments are being made in District-owned facilities to maintain their proper function and avoid disruption to needed public services.","progress_assessment":"This is an on-going project.","related_projects":"None.","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{},"design_complete":{},"construction_start":{},"construction_complete":{},"closeout":{}},"useful_life":10,"ward":"","est_cost":41577000,"lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2011,"last_year":2020,"cip_history":{"FY 2011":{"FY 2011":7000,"FY 2012":3000,"FY 2013":5000,"FY 2014":3000,"FY 2015":5000,"FY 2016":5000},"FY 2012":{"FY 2012":3030,"FY 2013":5183,"FY 2014":3401,"FY 2015":5221,"FY 2016":5393,"FY 2017":5197},"FY 2013":{"FY 2013":3665,"FY 2014":5167,"FY 2015":5221,"FY 2016":5393,"FY 2017":5197,"FY 2018":0},"FY 2014":{"FY 2014":7500,"FY 2015":5000,"FY 2016":0,"FY 2017":0,"FY 2018":0,"FY 2019":0},"FY 2015":{"FY 2015":3500,"FY 2016":2500,"FY 2017":2990,"FY 2018":0,"FY 2019":3000,"FY 2020":3000}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(01) Design":{"FY 2011":{"allotted":4500,"spent":2459,"proposed":7000},"FY 2012":{"allotted":11500,"spent":7558,"proposed":3030},"FY 2013":{"allotted":14530,"spent":-8395,"proposed":3665},"FY 2014":{"allotted":19087,"spent":17476,"proposed":7500},"FY 2015":{"allotted":20539,"spent":18265,"proposed":3500},"FY 2016":{"allotted":24039,"spent":18265,"proposed":2500},"FY 2017":{"allotted":26539,"spent":18265,"proposed":2990},"FY 2018":{"allotted":29529,"spent":18265,"proposed":0},"FY 2019":{"allotted":29529,"spent":18265,"proposed":3000},"FY 2020":{"allotted":32529,"spent":18265,"proposed":3000}},"(02) SITE":{"FY 2011":{"allotted":80,"spent":64,"proposed":0},"FY 2012":{"allotted":80,"spent":80,"proposed":0},"FY 2013":{"allotted":80,"spent":80,"proposed":105},"FY 2014":{"allotted":259,"spent":149,"proposed":0},"FY 2015":{"allotted":149,"spent":149,"proposed":0},"FY 2016":{"allotted":149,"spent":149,"proposed":0},"FY 2017":{"allotted":149,"spent":149,"proposed":0},"FY 2018":{"allotted":149,"spent":149,"proposed":0},"FY 2019":{"allotted":149,"spent":149,"proposed":0},"FY 2020":{"allotted":149,"spent":149,"proposed":0}},"(03) Project Management":{"FY 2011":{"allotted":1000,"spent":448,"proposed":799},"FY 2012":{"allotted":1769,"spent":1707,"proposed":226},"FY 2013":{"allotted":2726,"spent":1470,"proposed":515},"FY 2014":{"allotted":3666,"spent":3635,"proposed":322},"FY 2015":{"allotted":3699,"spent":3589,"proposed":700},"FY 2016":{"allotted":4399,"spent":3589,"proposed":0},"FY 2017":{"allotted":4399,"spent":3589,"proposed":0},"FY 2018":{"allotted":4399,"spent":3589,"proposed":0},"FY 2019":{"allotted":4399,"spent":3589,"proposed":0},"FY 2020":{"allotted":4399,"spent":3589,"proposed":0}},"(04) Construction":{"FY 2011":{"allotted":1520,"spent":505,"proposed":4100},"FY 2012":{"allotted":5550,"spent":2124,"proposed":1439},"FY 2013":{"allotted":6258,"spent":-15288,"proposed":2348},"FY 2014":{"allotted":8815,"spent":7573,"proposed":6754},"FY 2015":{"allotted":9200,"spent":7220,"proposed":2013},"FY 2016":{"allotted":11213,"spent":7220,"proposed":2500},"FY 2017":{"allotted":13713,"spent":7220,"proposed":2990},"FY 2018":{"allotted":16703,"spent":7220,"proposed":0},"FY 2019":{"allotted":16703,"spent":7220,"proposed":3000},"FY 2020":{"allotted":19703,"spent":7220,"proposed":3000}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY 2011":{"allotted":4500,"spent":2459,"proposed":7000},"FY 2012":{"allotted":11500,"spent":7557,"proposed":3030},"FY 2013":{"allotted":14530,"spent":-8394,"proposed":3665},"FY 2014":{"allotted":19087,"spent":17476,"proposed":7500},"FY 2015":{"allotted":20540,"spent":18266,"proposed":3500},"FY 2016":{"allotted":24040,"spent":18266,"proposed":2500},"FY 2017":{"allotted":26540,"spent":18266,"proposed":2990},"FY 2018":{"allotted":29530,"spent":18266,"proposed":0},"FY 2019":{"allotted":29530,"spent":18266,"proposed":3000},"FY 2020":{"allotted":32530,"spent":18266,"proposed":3000}},"Pay Go (0301)":{"FY 2012":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0}}},"total_funding":{"FY 2011":{"allotted":4500,"spent":2459,"proposed":7000},"FY 2012":{"allotted":11500,"spent":7558,"proposed":3030},"FY 2013":{"allotted":14530,"spent":-8395,"proposed":3665},"FY 2014":{"allotted":19087,"spent":17476,"proposed":7500},"FY 2015":{"allotted":20539,"spent":18265,"proposed":3500},"FY 2016":{"allotted":24039,"spent":18265,"proposed":2500},"FY 2017":{"allotted":26539,"spent":18265,"proposed":2990},"FY 2018":{"allotted":29529,"spent":18265,"proposed":0},"FY 2019":{"allotted":29529,"spent":18265,"proposed":3000},"FY 2020":{"allotted":32529,"spent":18265,"proposed":3000}}}}
