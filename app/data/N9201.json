This will be used on the new SAN (Storage Area Network). Disk-based backup allows us to rapidly stage data to disk before being run off to tape for longer retention, after a defined period in a disk-to-disk then it goes to tape. Using this form of technology allows us to perform quick restore for critical systems or in the event of a major data loss scenario this will allow rapid restores from backup.","justification":"Disk-based backup allows us to rapidly stage data to disk before being run off to tape for longer retention, after a defined period in a disk-to-disk then it goes to tape.
