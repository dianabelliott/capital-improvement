The building needs all new heating and cooling systems. The building does not have an adequate electrical system to support 21st century technology. The Petworth project will convert the 1927 building into a sustainable, energy efficient, state-of-the-art library while respecting the historic elements of the building. The renovated library will give the comunity better access to resources and information and provide opportunities for life long learning for all ages.","progress_assessment":"Exterior work complete February 2010.
