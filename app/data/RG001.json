This project includes urgent renovations to parks and recreation centers, replacement of water fountains, and major repairs, renovation, and installation of new heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems at various DC Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR) facilities across the city. The project also addresses major repairs, renovation, and replacement of roofing systems at various DPR facilities across the city. Many DPR facilities have experienced major roof leakage indicating that their roofs are beyond repair and require replacement. This project ensures funding is available to remediate deteriorated landscape and protect resources from the damaging effects of storm water runoff.  Also, DPR needs to bring more facilities into compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, and make more centers accessible to all citizens of the District by constructing additional ramps and expanding doorways where necessary.","justification":"General improvement projects address conditions considered significant enough to require substantial capital improvement.  These projects result in enhanced aesthetics and improved safety for District taxpayers.  General Improvements spending on parks and recreation centers is consistent with the Agency's objective to preserve and enhance the Districtâ€™s public open spaces, athletic fields, and landscaped parks as well as making sound investments in DPR's facility inventory.","progress_assessment":"General Improvements are ongoing.","related_projects":"QE511C ADA Compliance DPR","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{},"design_complete":{},"construction_start":{"projected":"10/01/2011"},"construction_complete":{"projected":"09/30/2016"},"closeout":{"projected":"09/30/2017"}},"useful_life":10,"facility":"VARIOUS","ward":"","est_cost":16357000,"lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2010,"last_year":2020,"cip_history":{"FY 2010":{"FY 2010":2650,"FY 2011":8435,"FY 2012":5570,"FY 2013":5570,"FY 2014":5985,"FY 2015":6278},"FY 2011":{"FY 2011":3571,"FY 2012":5570,"FY 2013":3570,"FY 2014":2993,"FY 2015":3139,"FY 2016":0},"FY 2012":{"FY 2012":4070,"FY 2013":5170,"FY 2014":15804,"FY 2015":9389,"FY 2016":16050,"FY 2017":14150},"FY 2013":{"FY 2013":2023,"FY 2014":2585,"FY 2015":2585,"FY 2016":2585,"FY 2017":4150,"FY 2018":0},"FY 2014":{"FY 2014":5885,"FY 2015":2665,"FY 2016":300,"FY 2017":300,"FY 2018":300,"FY 2019":300},"FY 2015":{"FY 2015":2865,"FY 2016":500,"FY 2017":500,"FY 2018":500,"FY 2019":500,"FY 2020":500}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(01) Design":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":24075,"spent":20855,"proposed":2650},"FY 2011":{"allotted":26746,"spent":21621,"proposed":3571},"FY 2012":{"allotted":27956,"spent":24460,"proposed":4070},"FY 2013":{"allotted":5850,"spent":330,"proposed":2023},"FY 2014":{"allotted":6874,"spent":1832,"proposed":5885},"FY 2015":{"allotted":10992,"spent":6878,"proposed":2865},"FY 2016":{"allotted":13857,"spent":6878,"new":500},"FY 2017":{"allotted":14357,"spent":6878,"new":500},"FY 2018":{"allotted":14857,"spent":6878,"new":500},"FY 2019":{"allotted":15357,"spent":6878,"new":500},"FY 2020":{"allotted":15857,"spent":6878,"new":500}},"(03) Project Management":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":2673,"spent":1977,"proposed":950},"FY 2011":{"allotted":3768,"spent":2386,"proposed":416},"FY 2012":{"allotted":3433,"spent":3036,"proposed":742},"FY 2013":{"allotted":1156,"spent":4,"proposed":0},"FY 2014":{"allotted":1007,"spent":344,"proposed":0},"FY 2015":{"allotted":1817,"spent":1516,"proposed":0},"FY 2016":{"allotted":1817,"spent":1516,"new":0},"FY 2017":{"allotted":1817,"spent":1516,"new":0},"FY 2018":{"allotted":1817,"spent":1516,"new":0},"FY 2019":{"allotted":1817,"spent":1516,"new":0},"FY 2020":{"allotted":1817,"spent":1516,"new":0}},"(04) Construction":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":19145,"spent":16926,"proposed":1500},"FY 2011":{"allotted":20521,"spent":17460,"proposed":2905},"FY 2012":{"allotted":21816,"spent":19216,"proposed":3078},"FY 2013":{"allotted":3915,"spent":279,"proposed":2023},"FY 2014":{"allotted":5334,"spent":1180,"proposed":5776},"FY 2015":{"allotted":8532,"spent":4863,"proposed":2741},"FY 2016":{"allotted":11273,"spent":4863,"new":500},"FY 2017":{"allotted":11773,"spent":4863,"new":500},"FY 2018":{"allotted":12273,"spent":4863,"new":500},"FY 2019":{"allotted":12773,"spent":4863,"new":500},"FY 2020":{"allotted":13273,"spent":4863,"new":500}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":24075,"spent":20854,"proposed":2650},"FY 2011":{"allotted":26746,"spent":21621,"proposed":3570},"FY 2012":{"allotted":27956,"spent":24460,"proposed":4070},"FY 2013":{"allotted":5849,"spent":322,"proposed":2023},"FY 2014":{"allotted":6774,"spent":1833,"proposed":5585},"FY 2015":{"allotted":10937,"spent":6878,"proposed":2365},"FY 2016":{"allotted":13302,"spent":6878,"new":0},"FY 2017":{"allotted":13302,"spent":6878,"new":0},"FY 2018":{"allotted":13302,"spent":6878,"new":0},"FY 2019":{"allotted":13302,"spent":6878,"new":0},"FY 2020":{"allotted":13302,"spent":6878,"new":0}},"Pay Go (0301)":{"FY 2013":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY 2014":{"allotted":100,"spent":0,"proposed":300},"FY 2015":{"allotted":54,"spent":0,"proposed":500},"FY 2016":{"allotted":554,"spent":0,"new":500},"FY 2017":{"allotted":1054,"spent":0,"new":500},"FY 2018":{"allotted":1554,"spent":0,"new":500},"FY 2019":{"allotted":2054,"spent":0,"new":500},"FY 2020":{"allotted":2554,"spent":0,"new":500}}},"total_funding":{"FY 2010":{"allotted":24075,"spent":20855,"proposed":2650},"FY 2011":{"allotted":26746,"spent":21621,"proposed":3571},"FY 2012":{"allotted":27956,"spent":24460,"proposed":4070},"FY 2013":{"allotted":5850,"spent":330,"proposed":2023},"FY 2014":{"allotted":6874,"spent":1832,"proposed":5885},"FY 2015":{"allotted":10992,"spent":6878,"proposed":2865},"FY 2016":{"allotted":13857,"spent":6878,"new":500},"FY 2017":{"allotted":14357,"spent":6878,"new":500},"FY 2018":{"allotted":14857,"spent":6878,"new":500},"FY 2019":{"allotted":15357,"spent":6878,"new":500},"FY 2020":{"allotted":15857,"spent":6878,"new":500}}}}
